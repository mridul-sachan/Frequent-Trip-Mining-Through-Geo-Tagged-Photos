      <description>The castle was built on the foundation of an ancient castle built by the Roman Empire in the forth century, undoubtedly against pirates. It was later on repaired by the Byzantine Empire and the Crusades. When Alaattin Keykubat I of Seljuk Turks captured the ruins of the castle in 1221, he built a larger castle partially using the foundation of the former castle. It was later on incorporated into the realm of Karamanids (A Turkish state in Anatolia in the Medieval ages.) Although the exact date is uncertain, according to an inscription erected by Ibrahim II of Karaman in 1450, the castle was captured during Mahmut's reign (1300–1308). The castle was renamed as Mamure (prosperous) after repaired by Mahmut.[1] In 1475, the castle was annexed by the Ottoman Empire. During Ottoman reign, the castle was repaired in the 15th, 16th and 18th centuries and a part of the castle was used as a cervansarai.

      <description>Being a memorial of the political enemy, even more the enemy who isolates the Cuban island, the memorial is not well cared. There is rubbish, leftovers, bones, and all steel is falling slowly into pieces by rust (the proximity of the salt water). 
However, it is still remaining without destruction, without vandalism or grafiti. Could you imagine a Cuban memorial in Washington?</description>

      <description>The battleship Maine was an armored cruiser of the United States Navy. 
During the Cuban revolt against the Spanish ruler, the battleship was sent to Havana to protect the US interests. 

On february 15 1898 the battleship exploded and sank, almost the entire crew died in the blast. 
The explosion was a mistery, the cause for the sinking was unclear and subject of speculation. It was never been proven that Spain was involved in the sinking of the Maine but many citizens in the US were convinced that the Maine was sank by the Spaniards.

Finally this led to the Spanish American war and the takeover of Spanish colonies by the United States, such as the Philippines. 
 

The bodies of the sailors who died on the Maine were buried in the Colón Cementery in Havana Vedado, some are buried in Arlington National Cementery. In 1926 the Cuban government installed a memorial dedicated to the victims of the Maine battleship along the Havana Malecon.

On february 15 1898 the battleship exploded and sank, almost the entire crew died in the blast. 
The explosion was a mistery, the cause for the sinking was unclear and subject of speculation. It was never been proven that Spain was involved in the sinking of the Maine but many citizens in the US were convinced that the Maine was sank by the Spaniards.

Finally this led to the Spanish American war and the takeover of Spanish colonies by the United States, such as the Philippines. 
 
The bodies of the sailors who died on the Maine were buried in the Colón Cementery in Havana Vedado, some are buried in Arlington National Cementery. In 1926 the Cuban government installed a memorial dedicated to the victims of the Maine battleship along the Havana Malecon.

      <description>The German seemen Carbonier and Thomsen of H.M.S. Meteor died in a seabattle near Havana on November 9, 1870. This memorial was errected by the German cititzens in Havana.

The Battle of Havana on 9 November 1870 was a single ship action between the German gunboat Meteor and the French aviso Bouvet off the coast of Havana, Cuba during the Franco-Prussian War.
 
At 8 a.m. on November 7 the Meteor arrived in Havana harbour after leaving Nassau some days before. An hour later the French aviso Bouvet arrived from Martinique, steaming in from the opposite direction. The next day the French mail steamer Nouveau Monde left the harbour for Veracruz but was forced to return a few hours later due to fears that she would be captured by the Prussian gunboat. Later that day the Meteor's captain, issued a formal challenge to the captain of the Bouvet to fight a battle the next day. The Bouvet accepted and steamed out of the harbour to wait for the Meteor. The Meteor had to wait 24 hours before it could meet the French vessel due to neutrality laws, since Spain was a neutral country during the conflict.
 
Upon the end of the 24 hour waiting period, the Meteor steamed out to meet the Bouvet which had been waiting 10 miles off the border of the Cuban territorial sea. As soon as Meteor had passed the border line, Bouvet opened fire on the German gunboat. The battle came to an inconclusive end when the Bouvet, which had closed the range in an attempt to board the Meteor, suffered damage to a steam pipe which knocked out her propulsion and was forced to retreat into neutral waters under sail, whereupon she came under the protection of Spain once again. Neither ship was permanently disabled, mostly suffering damage to masts and rigging (the Bouvet's boilers and machinery remaining intact and functioning) and very few killed and injured on either side. The battle was not considered significant by commentators of the day.

      <description>Thursday, 4th of Jan., the atmosphere was rather relaxed. Over the square are several tents decorated with the national flag. Protestors still remain here to indicate that there are more changes needed in their opinion. However, there was no violence whatsoever, it appeared more like Occupy-Wall-Street.</description>

      <description>The famous square on Thursday, 4th of January. 
When I had arrived two weeks ago, the square was blocked by army/police. This thursday things were relaxed and quiet...the usual beggars and tourist cheaters just waiting to make money.

However, on Friday morning a lot of Police had arrived for just in case as protests are usually massive after Friday prayers.</description>

      <description>The beautiful art deco building of Bacardi in Havana.

The Bacardí family (and hence the company) maintained a fierce opposition to Fidel Castro's revolution in Cuba in the 1960s. The Bacardí family and company left Cuba after it became clear that Castro was serious about his pledges for change; in particular, in nationalising and banning all private property on the island as well as all bank accounts. However, the company had started foreign branches a few years prior to the revolution; the company moved the all important Bacardi international trademarks out of the country to the Bahamas prior to the revolution as well as constructing a plant in Puerto Rico after the prohibition era to save in import taxes for rum being imported to the US. This helped the company survive after the communist government nationalised all Bacardi assets in the country.

Once they defeated the corrupt elite and did not show much respect towards the wishes of the United States...but what is left from that glory today? 
More than 50 years after the revolution and the Bay of Pigs invasion, the US administration is still isolating Cuba with all means as if it would be an actual threat to its safety. The US are cooperating with Russia and the Vietnamese, what makes it so difficult to reach out their hands to the Cubans? The Cubans are willing to do so.
It is like in kindergarten..one child doesn't want to play with the other because it has used its toy. The US are acting like children for 50 years. One should expect that a serious world power should be and act more mature.
The embargo and the pressure by the US to prevent neighbouring American and Caribbean countries to trade with Cuba are ridiculous.

The pension of Cuban veterans is so small, that those proud old men need to make money by posing for tourists...and it is the tourists who are willing to listen to their stories and adventures. The young Cuban generation isn't interested in their deeds.</description>

      <description>The building was build in 1929 and seems to be build according the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. In those days, relations had been very well between these countries and the US had been like a big brother (to express it friendly). The Capitolio was the seat of government in Cuba until after the Cuban Revolution in 1959. It is now home to the Cuban Academy of Sciences.</description>

The day when I arrived by bus from Cayo Levisa, Havana was waiting for me with this kind of weather and some 15 C.
At least at the Malecón it looked interesting and the clouds provided some sort of drama.</description>

      <description>On Sunday February 23, 1958, Fidel Castro's men, Oscar Lucero Moya and his team of nine kidnappers, kidnapped Fangio. They had discovered that he was staying at the Hotel Lincoln and from here they took him away to draw attention to the Cuban revolutionary cause.

Of course, Batista’s security forces were embarrassed. The kidnapping caused a sensation around the world and Castro's men achieved their target.

After three days, Fangio was released unharmed. He was treated very well and for him it was more an adventure than anything else. 

Castro did invite Fangio to return. Fango eventually returned to Cuba for business matters in 1981 and met with Castro (see photograph which is displayed in the Hotel Lincoln).</description>

      <description>The first Cuban Grand took place in February 1957 and the multiple World Champion Fangio, Juan Manuel Fangio, took part. He had some serious opposition in Stirling Moss and Phil Hill. Fangio returned in 1958 for a second race.

      <description>Okay, you might wonder why I took this photograph of an old, unknown man.

Let me try to explain: The entire ferry was filled with a big group of (American or European) tourists in the age of approx. 55 to 75 years. Except me, there were only two other backpackers. The group as such was decent...but the atmosphere among them was strange and cold. I mean it was really weird. None of them smiled.
Despite being in such a beautiful part of the world, despite enjoying the fruits of their work, the pleasure to live in luxury, to be well off, the group was split in couples and singles trying to ignore the others or to draw attention and to act important. 

In fact, it seemed to me they had a kind of competition: who is showing off more (all dressed up, the ladies wearing family jewellery with big stones, pearl necklaces and many men with expensive watches...keep in mind they were on the way to an island, not to a social event) and some of them showing off verbally where they had been travelling before and about their successes at home. It seemed to me, they had been under stress to prove how valuable they are. None of them seemed to realize the beauty of the place, to enjoy the fresh breeze and to be happy and grateful for it...until I found this old man.

He was sitting a bit apart. In sharp contrast to the rest of the group, he was dressed and acted humble. He did not seem to have great possessions such as a Rolex or fancy clothes. He did not fit into the group, most of all because he seemed to be happy. That simple! It made him appear pretty cool. 
He was just sitting in the sun, taking time to enjoy the sunlight and the warmth, the colours, the breeze, the fresh air. Somehow he had managed to ignore the &amp;quot;important&amp;quot; group around him. 
He enjoyed the moment, Carpe Diem...he was not thinking about the future nor the past but being aware of the moment. He really seemed to be in balance and harmony with himself and nature. So many people talk about it, write about it, but so few actually do it. He did it. He smiled all the way while the boat got closer and closer to the island. He was looking out to the sea and the island, realizing the beauty of it all. And...smiled. You saw that he was grateful to be here and truly happy. 
I took this photograph from the hips in order not to distrub him and you can see his authentic smile. I hope he doesn't mind.

I considered him a great person, a wise man! To me, he was the only person on board who had understood what is important in life and practised his wisdom. 

This picture is for all those who have understood it but who are still trying and striving to realize their wisdom into daily life :-)</description>

The Bay of Pigs Invasion was an unsuccessful action by a CIA-trained force of Cuban exiles to invade southern Cuba, with support and encouragement from the US government, in an attempt to overthrow the Cuban government of Fidel Castro. The invasion was launched in April 1961, less than three months after John F. Kennedy assumed the presidency in the United States. The Cuban armed forces, trained and equipped by Eastern Bloc nations, defeated the invading combatants within three days. Source: Wikipedia</description>

      <description>Officially named Castillo de San Pedro de la Roca , an UNESCO World Heritage site.

It was designed in 1637 by Giovanni Battista Antonelli (also known as Juan Battista Antonelli), a member of a Milanese family of military engineers, on behalf of the governor of the city, Pedro de la Roca y Borja, as a defense against raiding pirates, although an earlier, smaller, fortification had been built between 1590 and 1610. Construction of the citadel took 42 years, starting in 1638 and finally being completed in 1700. 
The fear of pirate attacks was well-founded. While the fortress was still being constructed in 1662, English freebooters under the guidance of Christopher Myngs took control of Santiago for two weeks and during their stay destroyed part of the fortification and captured the artillery. After they departed, the Spanish government ordered the reconstruction of the damaged part of the fortress and raised the garrison to 300 men. Between 1663 and 1669 the engineers Juan Císcara Ibáñez, Juan Císcara Ramirez and Francisco Perez worked on repairing the damage and improving the fortifications, strengthening the flanks and constructing a new artillery platform. In 1678 it frustrated the attack of a French squadron and in 1680 fought off another attack by 800 men led by Franquesma, the second-in-command of the Antilles filibusters.

The fortress was used in 1898 when the United States' fleet attacked Santiago de Cuba during the Spanish-American War.

The fear of pirate attacks was well-founded. While the fortress was still being constructed in 1662, English freebooters under the guidance of Christopher Myngs took control of Santiago for two weeks and during their stay destroyed part of the fortification and captured the artillery. After they departed, the Spanish government ordered the reconstruction of the damaged part of the fortress and raised the garrison to 300 men. Between 1663 and 1669 the engineers Juan Císcara Ibáñez, Juan Císcara Ramirez and Francisco Perez worked on repairing the damage and improving the fortifications, strengthening the flanks and constructing a new artillery platform. In 1678 it frustrated the attack of a French squadron and in 1680 fought off another attack by 800 men led by Franquesma, the second-in-command of the Antilles filibusters.

The fortress was used in 1898 when the United States' fleet attacked Santiago de Cuba during the Spanish-American War.

      <description>There is all over shortage of almost everything. Regarding food, there is enough food around but the quality of food is rather low. Pizza is regarded almost as basic nutrition..and its quality is usually not really good, more greasy than crispy with low quality ingredients. Based on the consumption I have seen in Cuba, no wonder so many people tend to be slightly overweight while there is in contrast in the entire country shortage. What is rather unusual in this photograph: there is no queue! Usually, there is almost everywhere a queue where something is provided. One Cuban guy told me half joking half serious that an average Cuban spends a third of his lifetime in queues... :-)</description>

On my way back, plenty of people were waiting to get a free ride downtown...many more than I could carry in my little car...public transport is a problem for many Cubans unless along the main routes.</description>

      <description>The road from Mayarí up to the hotel was among the worst I have experienced in all Cuba. The hotel however and the cuisine was among the best I had found. The hotel architecture is rather unusual.

By the time I had arrived in Mayarí from Holguín (in an horribly overpriced small rental car), it got dark. On that bad road it took me almost two hours to reach the hotel driving thru the night. Only when I woke up the next day I was able to realise the beauty of that area.</description>

      <description>There is a lot of cattle breeding and farming in Cuba. However, in order to generate foreign exchange, most of the beef is exported. The average Cubano cannot or only rarely afford beef steaks. Perhaps here in the countryside this is different.</description>

      <description>Here, spectators are waiting curiously what will happen next alongside the restricted area. It was amazing to see how relaxed the locals reacted on the bomb alert.
 I admit, I was among the spectators but less relaxed... about half an hour left to go for the airport.....I left with these impressions.

Eventually it turned out that the bag inside the shopping mall was not a bomb, merely a false alarm. However, these kind of terrorism is unfortunately reality. This month, several civilians died in Eilat, killed by some terrorists. It takes guts to attack armed soldiers in an open battle but it is coward to murder unarmed civilians.</description>

      <description>That was the last day of my trip. 
I had to depart from the hotel about 1 hour later towards the airport. 

While getting my backpack ready I noticed a lot of people and police right opposite of my hotel (the serie was taken from my hotel balcony).
It turned out to be a bomb alert. A bag was found within the shopping mall building and the area around was closed for pedestrians. A bomb squad was about to arrive.

I admit it made me a bit nervous (a bomb exploded close to me when I was in Sri Lanka) while it seemed not really to bother Israelis. They were extremely cool or making jokes...probably they are used to it. Whatever, it shows part of the daily life in this country where people, unfortunately, always need to fear this kind of coward attacks.</description>

      <description>The Templer settlement of Sarona was one of the first modern agricultural settlements in Palestine and became a model for the Jewish pioneers. In August 1871, the Templers purchased 60 hectares of land from a Greek monastery north of Jaffa. Part of the Plains of Sharon (after which it was named) near the River Audsche (Yarkon River) it was four kilometres from Jaffa. In October 1871, the foundation stones were laid for the first houses.

Extreme hardship and disease took a heavy toll in human life the first few years. Malaria caused the deaths of 28 of the 125 settlers of Sarona in 1872 alone. In an effort to dry the marshy land 1,300 eucalyptus trees were planted.

By 1889, 269 persons lived in Sarona. There were 41 homes, a communal hall, a winery, workshops, barns and sheds. The Sarona colonists brought modern farming tools and practices to the Holy Land. They focused on crops and products they could readily sell. This &amp;quot;agriculture-for-profit&amp;quot; was an economic innovation in a land that for centuries had practiced only &amp;quot;self-sustaining farming.&amp;quot; Grain crops and dairy industry first, then orchards and vineyards were planted. Faced with a shortage of financial resources for infrastructure development, the community introduced Frondienst, a compulsory work system where every male member was required to do a certain number of hours of community work each month. The building of roads, development of land, roads and drainage and community facilities could thus be scheduled. The researcher and author Sven Hedin wrote of his visit to Sarona in 1916 &amp;quot;...many plants were in blossom. They mainly grow grapes, oranges and vegetables, [but] like in old times they also produce milk and honey.&amp;quot;

In November 1917, British troops occupied Sarona, turning the community house into a field hospital and commandeering other buildings for military use. In July 1918, the Templers (a total of 850 people) were interned in Egypt at Helouan near Cairo. The Red Cross, Quakers and Unitarians took up their cause, and on July 29, 1920, after 270 internees had been repatriated in April to Bad Mergentheim in Germany, the House of Lords permitted the remaining internees to return to Palestine. The residents of Sarona returned to a plundered and vandalized colony. Following negotiations with the British authorities, compensation was paid, in some cases up to 50%.

By 1925 Sarona was still a small settlement, although grown in area. It was still a farming community but more emphasis was placed on tradesmen. With the increasing Jewish immigration to Palestine (80,000 immigrants arrived in 1920-1926 alone) the settlement prospered due to a ready market for their produce and their services.

After 1939, all Germans in Palestine turned into Enemy aliens. Some of the settlers with patriotic feelings went to Germany to join the war. Several were organised in Palestine in Nazi-organisations such as Hitler Youth, but many others were not. 

The British authorities decided to intern most of the enemy aliens. For this purpose four settlements Sarona, Bethlehem, Waldheim and Wilhelma were converted into internment camps. Sarona held close to 1,000 persons behind a guarded, 4 m high barbed-wire fence. In summer 1941, 665 German internees, almost all young families with children, were released to Australia, where they could settle again. Many of the remaining Germans were either too old or too sick, to leave for Australia, while a second group did not want to go there. In December 1941 and in the course of 1942 another 400 German internees, mostly wives and children of men, who had followed the calls for recruitment and had left for Germany, were released to Germany on the purpose of Family reunification. By that time, almost all Nazi supporters or partriots among the settlers had left Palestine.
By November 1944, most of the remaining Sarona residents had been moved to the camp in the colony Wilhelma.

In 1945 the Italian and Hungarian internees were released. But the Britons refused to repatriate the remaining German internees to the British zone in Germany, because the British zone was flooded with millions of war refugees. Also most of the internees did not want to go to Germany, they had their home in Palestine. In 1947 the British authorities and Australia agreed to allow the remaining German internees to emigrate to the fifth continent. The end of the Mandate forced to hurry the resettlement, thus all the internees were first transferred to Cyprus, to a camp of simple tents near Famagusta. 

By May 14, 1948, when Israel became independent, only about 50 Gentile Germans, mostly elderly and sick persons, were living in the new state. They voluntarily left the country or were successively expelled by the government.

The former Sarona houses were taken over and used by the British army and mandatory government, and as such were the target of raids and attacks by the Zionist underground organizations during their 1945–1947 struggle against British rule.

In 1948, when the British Mandate ended and British troops left Sarona, the old houses and army barracks were used by the newly-formed Israeli government as offices. The area became known as the &amp;quot;Kirya&amp;quot;. Part became a military compound, comprising the Israeli Ministry of Defense, the General Staff of the Israeli Defense Forces, and various other military installations. The pavement opposite the Ministry of Defense gate became since the 1970's the habitual venue for demonstrations by peace groups protesting government policies in the Occupied Territories. Other parts of the of the former Sarona were used to house the offices of civil ministries in the Israeli Government.

With the rapid growth of Tel Aviv, the Kirya became prime real-estate in the heart of the city. When plans for redeveloping the area were proposed in the mid-1970s, preservationists successfully campaigned against demolition. Consulting with historians, it was decided Sarona was of heritage value and 18 structures with distinct architectural styles would be preserved.

Since 2003, the Tel Aviv municipality has been working to preserve and restore Sarona. To make way for a highway, techniques were developed for moving some of the houses to a more convenient location.

      <description>The Templer settlement of Sarona was one of the first modern agricultural settlements in Palestine and became a model for the Jewish pioneers.

In December 1941 and in the course of 1942 another 400 German internees, mostly wives and children of men, who had followed the calls for recruitment and had left for Germany, were released to Germany on the purpose of Family reunification. By that time, almost all Nazi supporters or partriots among the settlers had left Palestine.
By November 1944, most of the remaining Sarona residents had been moved to the camp in the colony Wilhelma.

In 1945 the Italian and Hungarian internees were released. But the Britons refused to repatriate the remaining German internees to the British zone in Germany, because the British zone was flooded with millions of war refugees. Also most of the internees did not want to go to Germany, they had their home in Palestine. In 1947 the British authorities and Australia agreed to allow the remaining German internees to emigrate to the fifth continent. The end of the Mandate forced to hurry the resettlement, thus all the internees were first transferred to Cyprus, to a camp of simple tents near Famagusta. 

By May 14, 1948, when Israel became independent, only about 50 Gentile Germans, mostly elderly and sick persons, were living in the new state. They voluntarily left the country or were successively expelled by the government.

The former Sarona houses were taken over and used by the British army and mandatory government, and as such were the target of raids and attacks by the Zionist underground organizations during their 1945–1947 struggle against British rule.

In 1948, when the British Mandate ended and British troops left Sarona, the old houses and army barracks were used by the newly-formed Israeli government as offices. The area became known as the &amp;quot;Kirya&amp;quot;. Part became a military compound, comprising the Israeli Ministry of Defense, the General Staff of the Israeli Defense Forces, and various other military installations. The pavement opposite the Ministry of Defense gate became since the 1970's the habitual venue for demonstrations by peace groups protesting government policies in the Occupied Territories. Other parts of the of the former Sarona were used to house the offices of civil ministries in the Israeli Government.

With the rapid growth of Tel Aviv, the Kirya became prime real-estate in the heart of the city. When plans for redeveloping the area were proposed in the mid-1970s, preservationists successfully campaigned against demolition. Consulting with historians, it was decided Sarona was of heritage value and 18 structures with distinct architectural styles would be preserved.

Since 2003, the Tel Aviv municipality has been working to preserve and restore Sarona. To make way for a highway, techniques were developed for moving some of the houses to a more convenient location.

      <description>The Templer settlement of Sarona was one of the first modern agricultural settlements in Palestine and became a model for the Jewish pioneers. In August 1871, the Templers purchased 60 hectares of land from a Greek monastery north of Jaffa. Part of the Plains of Sharon (after which it was named) near the River Audsche (Yarkon River) it was four kilometres from Jaffa. In October 1871, the foundation stones were laid for the first houses.

Extreme hardship and disease took a heavy toll in human life the first few years. Malaria caused the deaths of 28 of the 125 settlers of Sarona in 1872 alone. In an effort to dry the marshy land 1,300 eucalyptus trees were planted.

By 1889, 269 persons lived in Sarona. There were 41 homes, a communal hall, a winery, workshops, barns and sheds. The Sarona colonists brought modern farming tools and practices to the Holy Land. They focused on crops and products they could readily sell. This &amp;quot;agriculture-for-profit&amp;quot; was an economic innovation in a land that for centuries had practiced only &amp;quot;self-sustaining farming.&amp;quot; Grain crops and dairy industry first, then orchards and vineyards were planted. Faced with a shortage of financial resources for infrastructure development, the community introduced Frondienst, a compulsory work system where every male member was required to do a certain number of hours of community work each month. The building of roads, development of land, roads and drainage and community facilities could thus be scheduled. The researcher and author Sven Hedin wrote of his visit to Sarona in 1916 &amp;quot;...many plants were in blossom. They mainly grow grapes, oranges and vegetables, [but] like in old times they also produce milk and honey.&amp;quot;

In November 1917, British troops occupied Sarona, turning the community house into a field hospital and commandeering other buildings for military use. In July 1918, the Templers (a total of 850 people) were interned in Egypt at Helouan near Cairo. The Red Cross, Quakers and Unitarians took up their cause, and on July 29, 1920, after 270 internees had been repatriated in April to Bad Mergentheim in Germany, the House of Lords permitted the remaining internees to return to Palestine. The residents of Sarona returned to a plundered and vandalized colony. Following negotiations with the British authorities, compensation was paid, in some cases up to 50%.

By 1925 Sarona was still a small settlement, although grown in area. It was still a farming community but more emphasis was placed on tradesmen. With the increasing Jewish immigration to Palestine (80,000 immigrants arrived in 1920-1926 alone) the settlement prospered due to a ready market for their produce and their services.

After 1939, all Germans in Palestine turned into Enemy aliens. Some of the settlers with patriotic feelings went to Germany to join the war. Several were organised in Palestine in Nazi-organisations such as Hitler Youth, but many others were not. 

The British authorities decided to intern most of the enemy aliens. For this purpose four settlements Sarona, Bethlehem, Waldheim and Wilhelma were converted into internment camps. Sarona held close to 1,000 persons behind a guarded, 4 m high barbed-wire fence. In summer 1941, 665 German internees, almost all young families with children, were released to Australia, where they could settle again. Many of the remaining Germans were either too old or too sick, to leave for Australia, while a second group did not want to go there.

      <description>Long before Jaffa became basically a part of Tel Aviv, it used to be a very important city for Palestine. Next to Akko, only Jaffa had a harbour which got connected to Jerusalem in 1891 by a French company. In 1891 when the station was opened, it was the first train station in the Middle East. At that time, Tel Aviv was a small Jewish colony. Tel Aviv had to wait until 1920 when it got its own train station (Tel Aviv South, which was in use until 1993).

During World War I, the railway was taken over by the Turkish and German armies, which adapted it to serve their needs. While the Jaffa Railway Station served as a military headquarters, the Ottomans did not want to expose the railway itself to British naval bombardment. In early 1915, most of the heavy machinery and equipment was moved to Jerusalem, and later in the same year he Jaffa–Lydda section was completely dismantled. Its rails and sleepers were used in the construction of the Railway to Be'er Sheva. The station was in service during British mandate until 1948. The service moved then to Tel Aviv South.

After being neglected for decades, the station was renovated and reopened as an entertainment centre in 2009.

      <description>At about 1870, the German Templars purchased houses on this ground from American settlers and extended existing buildings and the entire settlement. 

In 1868 the Templers started to create settlements in Palestine. First they purchased land that was far from the city of Haifa and set out to build the first planned agricultural community in the Holy Land. Hardegg stayed and established the community in Haifa, Hoffmann established the community one year later in Jaffa, who also built Sharona (today’s Kirya in Tel Aviv), and who enjoyed tremendous financial and agricultural success.
The Colony became a focus for Christian activity and one of the more well-known centers in the country for tourist services, like the &amp;quot;Thomas Cook&amp;quot; Travel Agency and the best hotels, such as the &amp;quot;Do Park Hotel&amp;quot;, owned by Baron Ustinov (Grandfather of Peter Ustinov, the actor). 

After the German settlers were driven out of Palestine (Nazi related before or during WW2, the last German settlers who had lived in Palestine since 1870, were forced to leave their homes in 1948. 

The houses of the former colonies were not cared and in miserable condition. During the last 10 years however, locals and local administrations are trying to safe most of the remaining buildings.

The Immanuel church was built by German settlers and inaugurated in 1904. From 1955 on, the Norwegian Church Ministry to Israel has been in charge of the church which was renovated in 1977-78.

This memorial plate is dedicated to Dr. Fr. von Braun who founded this church. Von Braun used to be the dean of Stuttgart in the German Kingdom of Württemberg (Southwest Germany).
&amp;quot;To its loyal friend, Dr. Fr. von Braun, dean of Stuttgart, who died in Jerusalem on May 31, 1904, bevor he was able to consecrate this church, this plate was errected for his honourful memory by the German-Protestant community of the Orient.&amp;quot;

      <description>George Jones Adams told farmers in Maine that they could help speed the messiah’s return, by helping to develop the Holy Land.

His followers were selling their properties and turning the proceeds over to Adams.
In August 1866 George J. Adams led a group of 156 members of the Church of the Messiah to Jaffa in order to become colonists. 

But on arrival in Jaffa, the colonists discovered that Adams had not obtained a parcel of land. Once the land was secured, the colonists constructed a church and school from their stock of lumber, surrounding it with 17 &amp;quot;neat square cottages.&amp;quot; Adams, for his part, ensconced himself in the best of the homes with most of the group’s supplies and all of their money.
Things quickly turned disastrous; the crops failed, supplies ran out. Most of the colonists were desperate to return home to Maine.
Some forty members went aboard a steamer heading for Egypt and came face-to-face with Mark Twain, who happened to be on the ship. The colony was a complete fiasco&amp;quot;, wrote Mark Twain in The Innocents Abroad, chapter 57.
 
After three years of poverty and disease the American Colony was forced to sell the houses. They were purchased by the German Templars who extended the buildings and the entire settlement.

The railway bridge is used as a dirtroad today.

In January 1915, the Ottomans built a military railroad from the Hejaz line (connection Afula/Sileh to Dera’a) to Be’er Sheva in order to support the supply for the Axis troops preparations to attack the Suez Canal.

The military railway had reached the newly build Asluj station (some 30 km before Hafir el Auja direction Sinai) in March 1916 and the station was inaugurated by Enver Pasha during his visit in the region. The line reached the station Hafir el Auja in May 1916. Despite these efforts, the efficiency of the line from Afula to Hafir was rather low. The line was further laid out and reached as far as Quseime (Kuseima) in Egypt.

At Bir Birein (Be'erotayim) a water refilling station for the railway was constructed as well as a railway bridge. In addition, a German truck unit was stationed (in tents) at Bir Birein supporting the second advance against the Suez Canal by transporting material to Quseime, Maghdaba and Nachl.

The second advance under Kress von Kressenstein with some 16.000 men in July/August 1916 did not reach the Suez Canal as the Allied had extended their defense positions effectively. The main result for the German-Ottoman effort was the concentration of large Allied forces (Battle of Romani). Among the German-Ottoman troops were 1.600 German soldiers, part of the Imperial German expeditionary forces (Asienkorps). 

The Allied forces with superior number of troops, material and supply gained more and more ground (conquering Sinai). El Arish was abandoned by Ottoman troops in Mid December 1916. 

The Allied started to attack Gaza in February 1917. In order to stabilize the front (line Gaza-Tel Sheria-Be’er Sheva), Kressenstein draw its remaining troops from Hafir back to Be’er Sheva in March 1917. Irregular British troops, Bedouins paid by the British, occupied Hafir soon after. According to Kressenstein, certain section of the tracks of the railway line from Hafir el Auja to Quseime were dismantled while the Allied troops were advancing and reused to build a new line from Et Tineh (Kiryat Malachi) to Huj in order to stabilize the supply to the Axis troops in Gaza. 
By end of April 1917 the outpost-garrison of Hafir el Auja was abandoned by the Ottomans. 

On May 8th, 1917, the Venezuelan adventurer Rafael de Nogales became Ottoman military governor of the Ottoman Sinai region. He had been serving in the Ottoman army earlier in Eastern Anatolia and the Iraq. By that time, the Ottomans had given up on the Sinai region. He was assigned an experienced group of Arab camel riders (Hedjin-Suaris), a kind of elite troop, plus an irregular volunteer regiment from El Arish. This regiment was commanded by the Bedouin Sheiks Hassan Erkienharb and Selim who did not wanted to subdue to the British forces in El Arish. The Ottoman target was to restrain the British forces in the area of El Arish, Magdhaba and Quseime (Kuseima). Hafir el Auja and Bir Biren (Birein) were chosen as base during the four weeks expedition. 

At about the same time, Allied troops such as the Camel Brigade and C Squadron, 11th Australian Light Horse Regiment, destroyed sections of the railway line between Hafir and Asluj as well as the station building Asluj during a one-week demolition raid. It is unclear if they also destroyed station buildings at Hafir during this raid.

De Nogales and his men left Be’er Sheva and expelled the British irregular troops from Hafir on May 15th. They started talks with local sheiks in order to regain back their ‘loyalty’. The word spread about their presence and the British sent troops but were unable to localize de Nogales and his Arabs. With the pressure and limited resources, de Nogales knew his days were counted and his men started sabotage attacks. British railway lines at El Arish were blown up and wells at Magdhaba. The Allied response came quickly. In end of May, large numbers of regular British troops started searching for the men forcing de Nogales to retreat to Be’er Sheva. De Nogales and his Arabs were the last Ottoman troops on Egypt territory.</description>

      <description>On the left of Tel Nitzana the ruins of the citadel and on the right the ruins of the German-Ottoman hospital.

Nitzana was a settlement founded by the Nabateans approx. in the 1st century BC. It is located on the ancient Incense Route, connecting Egypt with Palestine. In the settlement, the Nabateans had built a small fortress on the hill. In 106 AD, when the Nabatean kingdom was annexed by the Romans, the Nabateans abandoned the settlement. 

In the 4th century the place was resettled by the Byzantines. Also during Byzantine times, a church was built on the hill (Tel Nitzana) and the fort was extended including a hostel for pilgrims. Another church was erected in the lower part of the settlement.

Despite Nitzana was not immediately affected by the Arab conquest in the 7th century, the settlement was abandoned again around 800 AD and felt into ruins. Remaining buildings were used as caravanserai. Parts of the stones were used for house-construction in Gaza.

At around 1900, the Ottomans started to build a police post to serve as a administrative centre in the former settlement Nitzana, now called Hafir el Auja. Parts of the ancient ruins were used to construct buildings for the Ottoman settlement. Within the fort, the Ottomans started approx. in 1906 to construct a serail/palace but due to lack of material and funds only achieved to build a bit more than the foundation. 

In autumn 1914, the Germans and Ottoman planned an advance against the Suez Canal under Ottoman commander Ali Fuad Bey and German chief of staff of the Ottoman VIII. Army Kress von Kressenstein. When Kress von Kressenstein visited the area in October 1914, he noted the ruins of the fortress with the foundation of the palace on the hill, ruins of Byzantine churches and three Ottoman buildings (administrative building, police post and an empty house) in the lower part of the settlement next to ancient wells.

In preparation of the planned German-Ottoman advance against the Suez Canal, wells and water cisterns were built between Be’er Sheva and El Arish as well as simple roads. Further, it was given order to build a hospital on the foundation of the palace located on Tel Nitzana in end of 1914. 

In January 1915, works started to build a road from Hebron to Be’er Sheva in order to improve infrastructure and supply problems. Further, in January 1915, the Ottomans built a military railroad from the Hejaz line (connection Afula/Sileh to Dera’a) to Be’er Sheva.

The first expedition against the Suez Canal started on January 15 until February 13, 1915. The mixed German-Ottoman troops of approx. 25.000 men reached the canal but were not able to hold their positions mainly due to insufficient supply. 

The military railway had reached the newly build Asluj station (some 30 km before Hafir el Auja direction Sinai) in March 1916 and the station was inaugurated by Enver Pasha during his visit in the region. The line reached the station Hafir el Auja in May 1916. Despite these efforts, the efficiency of the line from Afula to Hafir was rather low.

By July 1916, the German-Ottoman hospital was not yet finished but already operating. Earlier, in February or March 1916, 4 Borromean sisters (Christian Sisters of Mercy of St Borromeo) were employed in the hospital as nurses. The Ottomans erected in mid-February 1916 a field hospital (Turkish Red Crescent) in Hafir el Auja in addition to the hospital.

The second advance under Kress von Kressenstein with some 16.000 men in July/August 1916 did not reach the Suez Canal as the Allied had extended their defense positions effectively. The main result for the German-Ottoman effort was the concentration of large Allied forces (Battle of Romani). Among the German-Ottoman troops were 1.600 German soldiers, part of the Imperial German expeditionary forces (Asienkorps). 

The German archaeologist K. Wulzinger made in September 1916 a survey in Auja for the Turko-German Committee for the Preservation of Ancient Monuments and discovered the first Nabatean painted pottery ever found in the Negev.

The Allied forces with superior number of troops, material and supply gained more and more ground (conquering Sinai). El Arish was abandoned in Mid December 1916. After the loss of the Ottoman area in Egypt, Hafir became an outpost-garrison with 4 battalions, 1 machine-gun company and 1 Ottoman mountain-howitzer battery. 

The Allied started to attack Gaza in February 1917. In order to stabilize the front (line Gaza-Tel Sheria-Be’er Sheva), Kressenstein draw its remaining troops from Hafir back to Be’er Sheva in March 1917. Irregular British troops, Bedouins paid by the British, occupied Hafir soon after. According to Kressenstein, certain section of the tracks of the railway line from Hafir el Auja to Quseime were dismantled while the Allied troops were advancing and reused to build a new line from Et Tineh (Kiryat Malachi) to Huj in order to stabilize the supply to the Axis troops in Gaza. 
By end of April 1917 the outpost-garrison of Hafir el Auja was abandoned by the Ottomans. 

On May 8th, 1917, the Venezuelan adventurer Rafael de Nogales became Ottoman military governor of the Ottoman Sinai region. He had been serving in the Ottoman army earlier in Eastern Anatolia and the Iraq. By that time, the Ottomans had given up on the Sinai region. He was assigned an experienced group of Arab camel riders (Hedjin-Suaris), a kind of elite troop, plus an irregular volunteer regiment from El Arish. This regiment was commanded by the Bedouin Sheiks Hassan Erkienharb and Selim who did not wanted to subdue to the British forces in El Arish. The Ottoman target was to restrain the British forces in the area of El Arish, Magdhaba and Quseime (Kuseima). Hafir el Auja and Bir Biren (Birein) were chosen as base during the four weeks expedition. 

At about the same time, Allied troops such as the Camel Brigade and C Squadron, 11th Australian Light Horse Regiment, destroyed sections of the railway line between Hafir and Asluj as well as the station building Asluj during a one-week demolition raid. It is unclear if they also destroyed station buildings at Hafir during this raid.

De Nogales and his men left Be’er Sheva and expelled the British irregular troops from Hafir on May 15th. They started talks with local sheiks in order to regain back their ‘loyalty’. The word spread about their presence and the British sent troops but were unable to localize de Nogales and his Arabs. With the pressure and limited resources, de Nogales knew his days were counted and his men started sabotage attacks. British railway lines at El Arish were blown up and wells at Magdhaba. The Allied response came quickly. In end of May, large numbers of regular British troops started searching for the men forcing de Nogales to retreat to Be’er Sheva. De Nogales and his Arabs were the last Ottoman troops on Egypt territory. As consequence, the British destroyed large sections of the railway between Hafir and Be’er Sheva. This time, on May 23rd, they blew up the big railway bridge at Asluj. It is possible that Ottoman railway buildings at Hafir were blown up as well.
Considering the defensive Ottoman military strategy based on limited resources, both demolition raids did not had an effect on the war. 

Hafir el Auja became part of the British mandate. The former Ottoman garrison Hafir el Auja was used as prison camp until 1948.

According to the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, the area was planned to become part of the Arab state and in 1948 the Egyptian Army used the area and the Ottoman buildings as a military base. Despite this plan Auja was captured in December 1948 by the Israeli 89th Mechanized Commando Battalion in the so called Battle of Auja al-Hafir, part of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. During the fighting, Israeli airplanes bombed the Egypt military base in Auja. Damages of the battle can still be seen in the ruins, e.g. on the old German-Ottoman hospital.

As a result of the Armistice Agreement of 1949, the area around the village became a demilitarized zone (DMZ). Israel re-militarized the area on September 21, 1955, and continued to occupy it until after its withdrawal from Sinai and Gaza in 1956. After this, and until the Six-Day-War, the DMZ and the border were monitored by the United Nations Emergency Force. Those Ottoman buildings which have not already been destroyed in the battle of 1948 were blown up by the Israeli army in September 1956 to prevent UN-troops to return to Nitzana. Of course, to the UN this would not have made much difference. They could have accomodated themselves in tents. Therefore, the destruction was useless. Some ruins and most fundaments are still visible.
Israel has full control of the area since 1967 and changed the name from Hafir el Auja to Nitzana.</description>

      <description>When standing (taking pictures) at the old Ottoman railway station, there was suddenly a vibration in the air and a lot of noise. I looked in all four directions but could not identify the reason for it which surprised me. Then, all of sudden, an Israeli military transport machine landed some 20 meters next to me. Of course I did not look up into the sky :-)

The military railway had reached the newly build Asluj station (some 30 km before Hafir el Auja direction Sinai) in March 1916 and the station was inaugurated by Enver Pasha during his visit in the region. The line reached the station Hafir el Auja in May 1916. Despite these efforts, the efficiency of the line from Afula to Hafir was rather low.

By July 1916, the German-Ottoman hospital was not yet finished but already operating. Earlier, in February or March 1916, 4 Borromean sisters (Christian Sisters of Mercy of St Borromeo) were employed in the hospital as nurses. The Ottomans erected in mid-February 1916 a field hospital (Turkish Red Crescent) in Hafir el Auja in addition to the hospital.

The second advance under Kress von Kressenstein with some 16.000 men in July/August 1916 did not reach the Suez Canal as the Allied had extended their defense positions effectively. The main result for the German-Ottoman effort was the concentration of large Allied forces (Battle of Romani). Among the German-Ottoman troops were 1.600 German soldiers, part of the Imperial German expeditionary forces (Asienkorps). 

The German archaeologist K. Wulzinger made in September 1916 a survey in Auja for the Turko-German Committee for the Preservation of Ancient Monuments and discovered the first Nabatean painted pottery ever found in the Negev.

The Allied forces with superior number of troops, material and supply gained more and more ground (conquering Sinai). El Arish was abandoned in Mid December 1916. After the loss of the Ottoman area in Egypt, Hafir became an outpost-garrison with 4 battalions, 1 machine-gun company and 1 Ottoman mountain-howitzer battery. 

The Allied started to attack Gaza in February 1917. In order to stabilize the front (line Gaza-Tel Sheria-Be’er Sheva), Kressenstein draw its remaining troops from Hafir back to Be’er Sheva in March 1917. Irregular British troops, Bedouins paid by the British, occupied Hafir soon after. According to Kressenstein, certain section of the tracks of the railway line from Hafir el Auja to Quseime were dismantled while the Allied troops were advancing and reused to build a new line from Et Tineh (Kiryat Malachi) to Huj in order to stabilize the supply to the Axis troops in Gaza. 
By end of April 1917 the outpost-garrison of Hafir el Auja was abandoned by the Ottomans. 

On May 8th, 1917, the Venezuelan adventurer Rafael de Nogales became Ottoman military governor of the Ottoman Sinai region. He had been serving in the Ottoman army earlier in Eastern Anatolia and the Iraq. By that time, the Ottomans had given up on the Sinai region. He was assigned an experienced group of Arab camel riders (Hedjin-Suaris), a kind of elite troop, plus an irregular volunteer regiment from El Arish. This regiment was commanded by the Bedouin Sheiks Hassan Erkienharb and Selim who did not wanted to subdue to the British forces in El Arish. The Ottoman target was to restrain the British forces in the area of El Arish, Magdhaba and Quseime (Kuseima). Hafir el Auja and Bir Biren (Birein) were chosen as base during the four weeks expedition. 

At about the same time, Allied troops such as the Camel Brigade and C Squadron, 11th Australian Light Horse Regiment, destroyed sections of the railway line between Hafir and Asluj as well as the station building Asluj during a one-week demolition raid. It is unclear if they also destroyed station buildings at Hafir during this raid.

De Nogales and his men left Be’er Sheva and expelled the British irregular troops from Hafir on May 15th. They started talks with local sheiks in order to regain back their ‘loyalty’. The word spread about their presence and the British sent troops but were unable to localize de Nogales and his Arabs. With the pressure and limited resources, de Nogales knew his days were counted and his men started sabotage attacks. British railway lines at El Arish were blown up and wells at Magdhaba. The Allied response came quickly. In end of May, large numbers of regular British troops started searching for the men forcing de Nogales to retreat to Be’er Sheva. De Nogales and his Arabs were the last Ottoman troops on Egypt territory. As consequence, the British destroyed large sections of the railway between Hafir and Be’er Sheva. This time, on May 23rd, they blew up the big railway bridge at Asluj. It is possible that Ottoman railway buildings at Hafir were blown up as well.
Considering the defensive Ottoman military strategy based on limited resources, both demolition raids did not had an effect on the war. 

Hafir el Auja became part of the British mandate. The former Ottoman garrison Hafir el Auja was used as prison camp until 1948.

According to the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, the area was planned to become part of the Arab state and in 1948 the Egyptian Army used the area and the Ottoman buildings as a military base. Despite this plan Auja was captured in December 1948 by the Israeli 89th Mechanized Commando Battalion in the so called Battle of Auja al-Hafir, part of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. During the fighting, Israeli airplanes bombed the Egypt military base in Auja. Damages of the battle can still be seen in the ruins, e.g. on the old German-Ottoman hospital.

As a result of the Armistice Agreement of 1949, the area around the village became a demilitarized zone (DMZ). Israel re-militarized the area on September 21, 1955, and continued to occupy it until after its withdrawal from Sinai and Gaza in 1956. After this, and until the Six-Day-War, the DMZ and the border were monitored by the United Nations Emergency Force. Those Ottoman buildings which have not already been destroyed in the battle of 1948 were blown up by the Israeli army in September 1956 to prevent UN-troops to return to Nitzana. Of course, to the UN this would not have made much difference. They could have accomodated themselves in tents. Therefore, the destruction was useless. Some ruins and most fundaments are still visible.
Israel has full control of the area since 1967 and changed the name from Hafir el Auja to Nitzana.</description>

      <description>In autumn 1914, the Germans and Ottoman planned an advance against the Suez Canal under Ottoman commander Ali Fuad Bey and German chief of staff of the Ottoman VIII. Army Kress von Kressenstein. When Kress von Kressenstein visited the area in October 1914, he noted the ruins of the fortress with the foundation of the palace on the hill, ruins of Byzantine churches and three Ottoman buildings (administrative building, police post and an empty house) in the lower part of the settlement next to ancient wells.

In preparation of the planned German-Ottoman advance against the Suez Canal, wells and water cisterns were built between Be’er Sheva and El Arish as well as simple roads. Further, it was given order to build a hospital on the foundation of the palace located on Tel Nitzana in end of 1914. 

In January 1915, works started to build a road from Hebron to Be’er Sheva in order to improve infrastructure and supply problems. Further, in January 1915, the Ottomans built a military railroad from the Hejaz line (connection Afula/Sileh to Dera’a) to Be’er Sheva.

      <description>In autumn 1914, the Germans and Ottoman planned an advance against the Suez Canal under Ottoman commander Ali Fuad Bey and German chief of staff of the Ottoman VIII. Army Kress von Kressenstein. When Kress von Kressenstein visited the area in October 1914, he noted the ruins of the fortress with the foundation of the palace on the hill, ruins of Byzantine churches and three Ottoman buildings (administrative building, police post and an empty house) in the lower part of the settlement next to ancient wells.

In preparation of the planned German-Ottoman advance against the Suez Canal, wells and water cisterns were built between Be’er Sheva and El Arish as well as simple roads. Further, it was given order to build a hospital on the foundation of the palace located on Tel Nitzana in end of 1914. 

In January 1915, works started to build a road from Hebron to Be’er Sheva in order to improve infrastructure and supply problems. Further, in January 1915, the Ottomans built a military railroad from the Hejaz line (connection Afula/Sileh to Dera’a) to Be’er Sheva.

The first expedition against the Suez Canal started on January 15 until February 13, 1915. The mixed German-Ottoman troops of approx. 25.000 men reached the canal but were not able to hold their positions mainly due to insufficient supply. 

The military railway had reached the newly build Asluj station (some 30 km before Hafir el Auja direction Sinai) in March 1916 and the station was inaugurated by Enver Pasha during his visit in the region. The line reached the station Hafir el Auja in May 1916. Despite these efforts, the efficiency of the line from Afula to Hafir was rather low.

By July 1916, the German-Ottoman hospital was not yet finished but already operating. Earlier, in February or March 1916, 4 Borromean sisters (Christian Sisters of Mercy of St Borromeo) were employed in the hospital as nurses. The Ottomans erected in mid-February 1916 a field hospital (Turkish Red Crescent) in Hafir el Auja in addition to the hospital.

The second advance under Kress von Kressenstein with some 16.000 men in July/August 1916 did not reach the Suez Canal as the Allied had extended their defense positions effectively. The main result for the German-Ottoman effort was the concentration of large Allied forces (Battle of Romani). Among the German-Ottoman troops were 1.600 German soldiers, part of the Imperial German expeditionary forces (Asienkorps). 

The German archaeologist K. Wulzinger made in September 1916 a survey in Auja for the Turko-German Committee for the Preservation of Ancient Monuments and discovered the first Nabatean painted pottery ever found in the Negev.

The Allied forces with superior number of troops, material and supply gained more and more ground (conquering Sinai). El Arish was abandoned in Mid December 1916. After the loss of the Ottoman area in Egypt, Hafir became an outpost-garrison with 4 battalions, 1 machine-gun company and 1 Ottoman mountain-howitzer battery. 

The Allied started to attack Gaza in February 1917. In order to stabilize the front (line Gaza-Tel Sheria-Be’er Sheva), Kressenstein draw its remaining troops from Hafir back to Be’er Sheva in March 1917. Irregular British troops, Bedouins paid by the British, occupied Hafir soon after. According to Kressenstein, certain section of the tracks of the railway line from Hafir el Auja to Quseime were dismantled while the Allied troops were advancing and reused to build a new line from Et Tineh (Kiryat Malachi) to Huj in order to stabilize the supply to the Axis troops in Gaza. 
By end of April 1917 the outpost-garrison of Hafir el Auja was abandoned by the Ottomans. 

On May 8th, 1917, the Venezuelan adventurer Rafael de Nogales became Ottoman military governor of the Ottoman Sinai region. He had been serving in the Ottoman army earlier in Eastern Anatolia and the Iraq. By that time, the Ottomans had given up on the Sinai region. He was assigned an experienced group of Arab camel riders (Hedjin-Suaris), a kind of elite troop, plus an irregular volunteer regiment from El Arish. This regiment was commanded by the Bedouin Sheiks Hassan Erkienharb and Selim who did not wanted to subdue to the British forces in El Arish. The Ottoman target was to restrain the British forces in the area of El Arish, Magdhaba and Quseime (Kuseima). Hafir el Auja and Bir Biren (Birein) were chosen as base during the four weeks expedition. 

At about the same time, Allied troops such as the Camel Brigade and C Squadron, 11th Australian Light Horse Regiment, destroyed sections of the railway line between Hafir and Asluj as well as the station building Asluj during a one-week demolition raid. It is unclear if they also destroyed station buildings at Hafir during this raid.

De Nogales and his men left Be’er Sheva and expelled the British irregular troops from Hafir on May 15th. They started talks with local sheiks in order to regain back their ‘loyalty’. The word spread about their presence and the British sent troops but were unable to localize de Nogales and his Arabs. With the pressure and limited resources, de Nogales knew his days were counted and his men started sabotage attacks. British railway lines at El Arish were blown up and wells at Magdhaba. The Allied response came quickly. In end of May, large numbers of regular British troops started searching for the men forcing de Nogales to retreat to Be’er Sheva. De Nogales and his Arabs were the last Ottoman troops on Egypt territory. As consequence, the British destroyed large sections of the railway between Hafir and Be’er Sheva. This time, on May 23rd, they blew up the big railway bridge at Asluj. It is possible that Ottoman railway buildings at Hafir were blown up as well.
Considering the defensive Ottoman military strategy based on limited resources, both demolition raids did not had an effect on the war. 

Hafir el Auja became part of the British mandate. The former Ottoman garrison Hafir el Auja was used as prison camp until 1948.

According to the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, the area was planned to become part of the Arab state and in 1948 the Egyptian Army used the area and the Ottoman buildings as a military base. Despite this plan Auja was captured in December 1948 by the Israeli 89th Mechanized Commando Battalion in the so called Battle of Auja al-Hafir, part of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. During the fighting, Israeli airplanes bombed the Egypt military base in Auja. Damages of the battle can still be seen in the ruins, e.g. on the old German-Ottoman hospital.

As a result of the Armistice Agreement of 1949, the area around the village became a demilitarized zone (DMZ). Israel re-militarized the area on September 21, 1955, and continued to occupy it until after its withdrawal from Sinai and Gaza in 1956. After this, and until the Six-Day-War, the DMZ and the border were monitored by the United Nations Emergency Force. Those Ottoman buildings which have not already been destroyed in the battle of 1948 were blown up by the Israeli army in September 1956 to prevent UN-troops to return to Nitzana. Of course, to the UN this would not have made much difference. They could have accomodated themselves in tents. Therefore, the destruction was useless. Some ruins and most fundaments are still visible.

      <description>At around 1900, the Ottomans started to build a police post to serve as a administrative centre in the former settlement Nitzana, now called Hafir el Auja.

Earlier, in February or March 1916, 4 Borromean sisters (Christian Sisters of Mercy of St Borromeo) were employed in the hospital as nurses. The hospital was closed with the withdrawal of the Ottoman forces in March 1917 to Be’er Sheva.

In summer 1917, the area became part of the British mandate and the former Ottoman garrison Hafir el Auja was used as prison camp until 1948. According to the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, the area was planned to become part of the Arab state and in 1948 the Egyptian Army used the area and the Ottoman buildings as a military base. 
Despite this plan Auja was captured in December 1948 by the Israeli 89th Mechanized Commando Battalion in the so called Battle of Auja al-Hafir during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. During the fighting Israeli airplanes bombed the Egypt military base in Auja. Damages of the battle can still be seen in the ruins, e.g. on the old German-Ottoman hospital.</description>

      <description>At around 1900, the Ottomans started to build a police post to serve as a administrative centre in the former settlement Nitzana, now called Hafir el Auja. Parts of the ancient ruins were used to construct buildings for the Ottoman settlement. Within the fort, the Ottomans started approx. in 1906 to construct a serail/palace but due to lack of material and funds only achieved to build a bit more than the foundation. 

In autumn 1914, the Germans and Ottoman planned an advance against the Suez Canal under Ottoman commander Ali Fuad Bey and German chief of staff of the Ottoman VIII. Army Kress von Kressenstein. When Kress von Kressenstein visited the area in October 1914, he noted the ruins of the fortress with the foundation of the palace on the hill, ruins of Byzantine churches and three Ottoman buildings (administrative building, police post and an empty house) in the lower part of the settlement next to ancient wells.

In preparation of the planned German-Ottoman advance against the Suez Canal, wells and water cisterns were built between Be’er Sheva and El Arish as well as simple roads. Further, it was given order to build a hospital on the foundation of the palace located on Tel Nitzana in end of 1914. 

In January 1915, works started to build a road from Hebron to Be’er Sheva in order to improve infrastructure and supply problems. Further, in January 1915, the Ottomans built a military railroad from the Hejaz line (connection Afula/Sileh to Dera’a) to Be’er Sheva.

The first expedition against the Suez Canal started on January 15 until February 13, 1915. The mixed German-Ottoman troops of approx. 25.000 men reached the canal but were not able to hold their positions mainly due to insufficient supply. 

The military railway had reached the newly build Asluj station (some 30 km before Hafir el Auja direction Sinai) in March 1916 and the station was inaugurated by Enver Pasha during his visit in the region. The line reached the station Hafir el Auja in May 1916. Despite these efforts, the efficiency of the line from Afula to Hafir was rather low.

By July 1916, the German-Ottoman hospital was not yet finished but already operating. Earlier, in February or March 1916, 4 Borromean sisters (Christian Sisters of Mercy of St Borromeo) were employed in the hospital as nurses. The Ottomans erected in mid-February 1916 a field hospital (Turkish Red Crescent) in Hafir el Auja in addition to the hospital.

The second advance under Kress von Kressenstein with some 16.000 men in July/August 1916 did not reach the Suez Canal as the Allied had extended their defense positions effectively. The main result for the German-Ottoman effort was the concentration of large Allied forces (Battle of Romani). Among the German-Ottoman troops were 1.600 German soldiers, part of the Imperial German expeditionary forces (Asienkorps). 

The German archaeologist K. Wulzinger made in September 1916 a survey in Auja for the Turko-German Committee for the Preservation of Ancient Monuments and discovered the first Nabatean painted pottery ever found in the Negev.

The Allied forces with superior number of troops, material and supply gained more and more ground (conquering Sinai). El Arish was abandoned in Mid December 1916. After the loss of the Ottoman area in Egypt, Hafir became an outpost-garrison with 4 battalions, 1 machine-gun company and 1 Ottoman mountain-howitzer battery. 

The Allied started to attack Gaza in February 1917. In order to stabilize the front (line Gaza-Tel Sheria-Be’er Sheva), Kressenstein draw its remaining troops from Hafir back to Be’er Sheva in March 1917. Irregular British troops, Bedouins paid by the British, occupied Hafir soon after. According to Kressenstein, certain section of the tracks of the railway line from Hafir el Auja to Quseime were dismantled while the Allied troops were advancing and reused to build a new line from Et Tineh (Kiryat Malachi) to Huj in order to stabilize the supply to the Axis troops in Gaza. 
By end of April 1917 the outpost-garrison of Hafir el Auja was abandoned by the Ottomans. 

On May 8th, 1917, the Venezuelan adventurer Rafael de Nogales became Ottoman military governor of the Ottoman Sinai region. He had been serving in the Ottoman army earlier in Eastern Anatolia and the Iraq. By that time, the Ottomans had given up on the Sinai region. He was assigned an experienced group of Arab camel riders (Hedjin-Suaris), a kind of elite troop, plus an irregular volunteer regiment from El Arish. This regiment was commanded by the Bedouin Sheiks Hassan Erkienharb and Selim who did not wanted to subdue to the British forces in El Arish. The Ottoman target was to restrain the British forces in the area of El Arish, Magdhaba and Quseime (Kuseima). Hafir el Auja and Bir Biren (Birein) were chosen as base during the four weeks expedition. 

At about the same time, Allied troops such as the Camel Brigade and C Squadron, 11th Australian Light Horse Regiment, destroyed sections of the railway line between Hafir and Asluj as well as the station building Asluj during a one-week demolition raid. It is unclear if they also destroyed station buildings at Hafir during this raid.

De Nogales and his men left Be’er Sheva and expelled the British irregular troops from Hafir on May 15th. They started talks with local sheiks in order to regain back their ‘loyalty’. The word spread about their presence and the British sent troops but were unable to localize de Nogales and his Arabs. With the pressure and limited resources, de Nogales knew his days were counted and his men started sabotage attacks. British railway lines at El Arish were blown up and wells at Magdhaba. The Allied response came quickly. In end of May, large numbers of regular British troops started searching for the men forcing de Nogales to retreat to Be’er Sheva. De Nogales and his Arabs were the last Ottoman troops on Egypt territory. As consequence, the British destroyed large sections of the railway between Hafir and Be’er Sheva. This time, on May 23rd, they blew up the big railway bridge at Asluj. It is possible that Ottoman railway buildings at Hafir were blown up as well.
Considering the defensive Ottoman military strategy based on limited resources, both demolition raids did not had an effect on the war. 

Hafir el Auja became part of the British mandate. The former Ottoman garrison Hafir el Auja was used as prison camp until 1948.

According to the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, the area was planned to become part of the Arab state and in 1948 the Egyptian Army used the area and the Ottoman buildings as a military base. Despite this plan Auja was captured in December 1948 by the Israeli 89th Mechanized Commando Battalion in the so called Battle of Auja al-Hafir, part of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. During the fighting, Israeli airplanes bombed the Egypt military base in Auja. Damages of the battle can still be seen in the ruins, e.g. on the old German-Ottoman hospital.

As a result of the Armistice Agreement of 1949, the area around the village became a demilitarized zone (DMZ). Israel re-militarized the area on September 21, 1955, and continued to occupy it until after its withdrawal from Sinai and Gaza in 1956. After this, and until the Six-Day-War, the DMZ and the border were monitored by the United Nations Emergency Force. Those Ottoman buildings which have not already been destroyed in the battle of 1948 were blown up by the Israeli army in September 1956 to prevent UN-troops to return to Nitzana. Of course, to the UN this would not have made much difference. They could have accomodated themselves in tents. Therefore, the destruction was useless. Some ruins and most fundaments are still visible.
Israel has full control of the area since 1967 and changed the name from Hafir el Auja to Nitzana.</description>

In order to stabilize the front (line Gaza-Tel Sheria-Be’er Sheva), Kressenstein draw its remaining troops from Hafir back to Be’er Sheva in March 1917. Irregular British troops, Bedouins paid by the British, occupied Hafir soon after. According to Kressenstein, certain section of the tracks of the railway line from Hafir el Auja to Quseime were dismantled while the Allied troops were advancing and reused to build a new line from Et Tineh (Kiryat Malachi) to Huj in order to stabilize the supply to the Axis troops in Gaza. 
By end of April 1917 the outpost-garrison of Hafir el Auja was abandoned by the Ottomans. 

On May 8th, 1917, the Venezuelan adventurer Rafael de Nogales became Ottoman military governor of the Ottoman Sinai region. He had been serving in the Ottoman army earlier in Eastern Anatolia and the Iraq. By that time, the Ottomans had given up on the Sinai region. He was assigned an experienced group of Arab camel riders (Hedjin-Suaris), a kind of elite troop, plus an irregular volunteer regiment from El Arish. This regiment was commanded by the Bedouin Sheiks Hassan Erkienharb and Selim who did not wanted to subdue to the British forces in El Arish. The Ottoman target was to restrain the British forces in the area of El Arish, Magdhaba and Quseime (Kuseima). Hafir el Auja and Bir Biren (Birein) were chosen as base during the four weeks expedition. 

At about the same time, Allied troops such as the Camel Brigade and C Squadron, 11th Australian Light Horse Regiment, destroyed sections of the railway line between Hafir and Asluj as well as the station building Asluj during a one-week demolition raid. It is unclear if they also destroyed station buildings at Hafir during this raid.

De Nogales and his men left Be’er Sheva and expelled the British irregular troops from Hafir on May 15th. They started talks with local sheiks in order to regain back their ‘loyalty’. The word spread about their presence and the British sent troops but were unable to localize de Nogales and his Arabs. With the pressure and limited resources, de Nogales knew his days were counted and his men started sabotage attacks. British railway lines at El Arish were blown up and wells at Magdhaba. The Allied response came quickly. In end of May, large numbers of regular British troops started searching for the men forcing de Nogales to retreat to Be’er Sheva. De Nogales and his Arabs were the last Ottoman troops on Egypt territory. As consequence, the British destroyed large sections of the railway between Hafir and Be’er Sheva. This time, on May 23rd, they blew up the big railway bridge at Asluj. It is possible that Ottoman railway buildings at Hafir were blown up as well.
Considering the defensive Ottoman military strategy based on limited resources, both demolition raids did not had an effect on the war. 

Hafir el Auja became part of the British mandate. The former Ottoman garrison Hafir el Auja was used as prison camp until 1948.

According to the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, the area was planned to become part of the Arab state and in 1948 the Egyptian Army used the area and the Ottoman buildings as a military base. Despite this plan Auja was captured in December 1948 by the Israeli 89th Mechanized Commando Battalion in the so called Battle of Auja al-Hafir, part of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. During the fighting, Israeli airplanes bombed the Egypt military base in Auja. Damages of the battle can still be seen in the ruins, e.g. on the old German-Ottoman hospital.

As a result of the Armistice Agreement of 1949, the area around the village became a demilitarized zone (DMZ). Israel re-militarized the area on September 21, 1955, and continued to occupy it until after its withdrawal from Sinai and Gaza in 1956. After this, and until the Six-Day-War, the DMZ and the border were monitored by the United Nations Emergency Force. Those Ottoman buildings which have not already been destroyed in the battle of 1948 were blown up by the Israeli army in September 1956 to prevent UN-troops to return to Nitzana. Of course, to the UN this would not have made much difference. They could have accomodated themselves in tents. Therefore, the destruction was useless. Some ruins and most fundaments are still visible.
Israel has full control of the area since 1967 and changed the name from Hafir el Auja to Nitzana.</description>

      <description>On the left of Tel Nitzana the ruins of the citadel and on the right the ruins of the German-Ottoman hospital.

Nitzana was a settlement founded by the Nabateans approx. in the 1st century BC. It is located on the ancient Incense Route, connecting Egypt with Palestine. In the settlement, the Nabateans had built a small fortress on the hill. In 106 AD, when the Nabatean kingdom was annexed by the Romans, the Nabateans abandoned the settlement. 

In the 4th century the place was resettled by the Byzantines. Also during Byzantine times, a church was built on the hill (Tel Nitzana) and the fort was extended including a hostel for pilgrims. Another church was erected in the lower part of the settlement.

Despite Nitzana was not immediately affected by the Arab conquest in the 7th century, the settlement was abandoned again around 800 AD and felt into ruins. Remaining buildings were used as caravanserai. Parts of the stones were used for house-construction in Gaza.

At around 1900, the Ottomans started to build a police post to serve as a administrative centre in the former settlement Nitzana, now called Hafir el Auja. Parts of the ancient ruins were used to construct buildings for the Ottoman settlement. Within the fort, the Ottomans started approx. in 1906 to construct a serail/palace but due to lack of material and funds only achieved to build a bit more than the foundation. 

In autumn 1914, the Germans and Ottoman planned an advance against the Suez Canal under Ottoman commander Ali Fuad Bey and German chief of staff of the Ottoman VIII. Army Kress von Kressenstein. When Kress von Kressenstein visited the area in October 1914, he noted the ruins of the fortress with the foundation of the palace on the hill, ruins of Byzantine churches and three Ottoman buildings (administrative building, police post and an empty house) in the lower part of the settlement next to ancient wells.

In preparation of the planned German-Ottoman advance against the Suez Canal, wells and water cisterns were built between Be’er Sheva and El Arish as well as simple roads. Further, it was given order to build a hospital on the foundation of the palace located on Tel Nitzana in end of 1914. 

In January 1915, works started to build a road from Hebron to Be’er Sheva in order to improve infrastructure and supply problems. Further, in January 1915, the Ottomans built a military railroad from the Hejaz line (connection Afula/Sileh to Dera’a) to Be’er Sheva.

The first expedition against the Suez Canal started on January 15 until February 13, 1915. The mixed German-Ottoman troops of approx. 25.000 men reached the canal but were not able to hold their positions mainly due to insufficient supply. 

The military railway had reached the newly build Asluj station (some 30 km before Hafir el Auja direction Sinai) in March 1916 and the station was inaugurated by Enver Pasha during his visit in the region. The line reached the station Hafir el Auja in May 1916. Despite these efforts, the efficiency of the line from Afula to Hafir was rather low.

By July 1916, the German-Ottoman hospital was not yet finished but already operating. Earlier, in February or March 1916, 4 Borromean sisters (Christian Sisters of Mercy of St Borromeo) were employed in the hospital as nurses. The Ottomans erected in mid-February 1916 a field hospital (Turkish Red Crescent) in Hafir el Auja in addition to the hospital.

The second advance under Kress von Kressenstein with some 16.000 men in July/August 1916 did not reach the Suez Canal as the Allied had extended their defense positions effectively. The main result for the German-Ottoman effort was the concentration of large Allied forces (Battle of Romani). Among the German-Ottoman troops were 1.600 German soldiers, part of the Imperial German expeditionary forces (Asienkorps). 

The German archaeologist K. Wulzinger made in September 1916 a survey in Auja for the Turko-German Committee for the Preservation of Ancient Monuments and discovered the first Nabatean painted pottery ever found in the Negev.

The Allied forces with superior number of troops, material and supply gained more and more ground (conquering Sinai). El Arish was abandoned in Mid December 1916. After the loss of the Ottoman area in Egypt, Hafir became an outpost-garrison with 4 battalions, 1 machine-gun company and 1 Ottoman mountain-howitzer battery.

This regiment was commanded by the Bedouin Sheiks Hassan Erkienharb and Selim who did not wanted to subdue to the British forces in El Arish. The Ottoman target was to restrain the British forces in the area of El Arish, Magdhaba and Quseime (Kuseima). Hafir el Auja and Bir Biren (Birein) were chosen as base during the four weeks expedition. 

At about the same time, Allied troops such as the Camel Brigade and C Squadron, 11th Australian Light Horse Regiment, destroyed sections of the railway line between Hafir and Asluj as well as the station building Asluj during a one-week demolition raid. It is unclear if they also destroyed station buildings at Hafir during this raid.

De Nogales and his men left Be’er Sheva and expelled the British irregular troops from Hafir on May 15th. They started talks with local sheiks in order to regain back their ‘loyalty’. The word spread about their presence and the British sent troops but were unable to localize de Nogales and his Arabs. With the pressure and limited resources, de Nogales knew his days were counted and his men started sabotage attacks. British railway lines at El Arish were blown up and wells at Magdhaba. The Allied response came quickly. In end of May, large numbers of regular British troops started searching for the men forcing de Nogales to retreat to Be’er Sheva. De Nogales and his Arabs were the last Ottoman troops on Egypt territory. As consequence, the British destroyed large sections of the railway between Hafir and Be’er Sheva. This time, on May 23rd, they blew up the big railway bridge at Asluj. It is possible that Ottoman railway buildings at Hafir were blown up as well.
Considering the defensive Ottoman military strategy based on limited resources, both demolition raids did not had an effect on the war. 

Hafir el Auja became part of the British mandate. The former Ottoman garrison Hafir el Auja was used as prison camp until 1948.

According to the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, the area was planned to become part of the Arab state and in 1948 the Egyptian Army used the area and the Ottoman buildings as a military base. Despite this plan Auja was captured in December 1948 by the Israeli 89th Mechanized Commando Battalion in the so called Battle of Auja al-Hafir, part of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. During the fighting, Israeli airplanes bombed the Egypt military base in Auja. Damages of the battle can still be seen in the ruins, e.g. on the old German-Ottoman hospital.

As a result of the Armistice Agreement of 1949, the area around the village became a demilitarized zone (DMZ). Israel re-militarized the area on September 21, 1955, and continued to occupy it until after its withdrawal from Sinai and Gaza in 1956. After this, and until the Six-Day-War, the DMZ and the border were monitored by the United Nations Emergency Force. Those Ottoman buildings which have not already been destroyed in the battle of 1948 were blown up by the Israeli army in September 1956 to prevent UN-troops to return to Nitzana. Of course, to the UN this would not have made much difference. They could have accomodated themselves in tents. Therefore, the destruction was useless. Some ruins and most fundaments are still visible.
Israel has full control of the area since 1967 and changed the name from Hafir el Auja to Nitzana.</description>

      <description>GHH stands for the German company 'Gute Hoffnungshütte', this sleeper is marked with its year of production 1910.
 
At around 1900, the Ottomans started to build a police post to serve as a administrative centre in the former settlement Nitzana, now called Hafir el Auja. Parts of the ancient ruins were used to construct buildings for the Ottoman settlement. Within the fort, the Ottomans started approx. in 1906 to construct a serail/palace but due to lack of material and funds only achieved to build a bit more than the foundation. 

In autumn 1914, the Germans and Ottoman planned an advance against the Suez Canal under Ottoman commander Ali Fuad Bey and German chief of staff of the Ottoman VIII. Army Kress von Kressenstein. When Kress von Kressenstein visited the area in October 1914, he noted the ruins of the fortress with the foundation of the palace on the hill, ruins of Byzantine churches and three Ottoman buildings (administrative building, police post and an empty house) in the lower part of the settlement next to ancient wells.

In preparation of the planned German-Ottoman advance against the Suez Canal, wells and water cisterns were built between Be’er Sheva and El Arish as well as simple roads. Further, it was given order to build a hospital on the foundation of the palace located on Tel Nitzana in end of 1914. 

In January 1915, works started to build a road from Hebron to Be’er Sheva in order to improve infrastructure and supply problems. Further, in January 1915, the Ottomans built a military railroad from the Hejaz line (connection Afula/Sileh to Dera’a) to Be’er Sheva.

The first expedition against the Suez Canal started on January 15 until February 13, 1915. The mixed German-Ottoman troops of approx. 25.000 men reached the canal but were not able to hold their positions mainly due to insufficient supply. 

The military railway had reached the newly build Asluj station (some 30 km before Hafir el Auja direction Sinai) in March 1916 and the station was inaugurated by Enver Pasha during his visit in the region. The line reached the station Hafir el Auja in May 1916. Despite these efforts, the efficiency of the line from Afula to Hafir was rather low.

By July 1916, the German-Ottoman hospital was not yet finished but already operating. Earlier, in February or March 1916, 4 Borromean sisters (Christian Sisters of Mercy of St Borromeo) were employed in the hospital as nurses. The Ottomans erected in mid-February 1916 a field hospital (Turkish Red Crescent) in Hafir el Auja in addition to the hospital.

The second advance under Kress von Kressenstein with some 16.000 men in July/August 1916 did not reach the Suez Canal as the Allied had extended their defense positions effectively. The main result for the German-Ottoman effort was the concentration of large Allied forces (Battle of Romani). Among the German-Ottoman troops were 1.600 German soldiers, part of the Imperial German expeditionary forces (Asienkorps). 

The German archaeologist K. Wulzinger made in September 1916 a survey in Auja for the Turko-German Committee for the Preservation of Ancient Monuments and discovered the first Nabatean painted pottery ever found in the Negev.

The Allied forces with superior number of troops, material and supply gained more and more ground (conquering Sinai). El Arish was abandoned in Mid December 1916. After the loss of the Ottoman area in Egypt, Hafir became an outpost-garrison with 4 battalions, 1 machine-gun company and 1 Ottoman mountain-howitzer battery. 

The Allied started to attack Gaza in February 1917. In order to stabilize the front (line Gaza-Tel Sheria-Be’er Sheva), Kressenstein draw its remaining troops from Hafir back to Be’er Sheva in March 1917. Irregular British troops, Bedouins paid by the British, occupied Hafir soon after. According to Kressenstein, certain section of the tracks of the railway line from Hafir el Auja to Quseime were dismantled while the Allied troops were advancing and reused to build a new line from Et Tineh (Kiryat Malachi) to Huj in order to stabilize the supply to the Axis troops in Gaza. 
By end of April 1917 the outpost-garrison of Hafir el Auja was abandoned by the Ottomans. 

On May 8th, 1917, the Venezuelan adventurer Rafael de Nogales became Ottoman military governor of the Ottoman Sinai region. He had been serving in the Ottoman army earlier in Eastern Anatolia and the Iraq. By that time, the Ottomans had given up on the Sinai region. He was assigned an experienced group of Arab camel riders (Hedjin-Suaris), a kind of elite troop, plus an irregular volunteer regiment from El Arish.

      <description>The Battle of 'Auja, also called Battle of Nitzana, was a military engagement between the Israel Defense Forces and the Egyptian Army in and around 'Auja (today Nitzana), a small village on the Egypt–Israel border. It was fought on December 26–27, 1948, as part of Operation Horev, an Israeli campaign meant to expel all Egyptian forces from the country. The first stage of the operation was the simultaneous capture of 18 Egyptian positions on the Beersheba–'Auja road, including 7 around 'Auja.
 
The attack was conducted by 8th Brigade forces, reinforced by troops from the Harel Brigade. It started with maneuvers to the north of 'Auja, which bogged down the Israeli forces that only began the actual assault on December 26. The battle was won in the afternoon of December 27, but only on the morning of December 28 did the 8th Brigade take the two final positions, completing the capture of all 18.

According to information from an Israeli friend, the Israeli Army had in 1956 no more use for the Ottoman railway buildings and neither of Ottoman village buildings in Hafir. Unless they were not already destroyed in the battle of 1948, all buildings were blown up by the Israeli army. Some ruins are still visible.
Israel has full control of the area since 1967 and changed the name from Hafir el Auja to Nitzana.</description>

      <description>The photographs shows Tel Nitzana in the background and ruins of the Ottoman village in the foreground. 

Nitzana was a settlement founded by the Nabateans approx. in the 1st century BC. It is located on the ancient Incense Route, connecting Egypt with Palestine. In the settlement, the Nabateans had built a small fortress on the hill. In 106 AD, when the Nabatean kingdom was annexed by the Romans, the Nabateans abandoned the settlement. 

In the 4th century the place was resettled by the Byzantines. Also during Byzantine times, a church was built on the hill (Tel Nitzana) and the fort was extended including a hostel for pilgrims. Another church was erected in the lower part of the settlement.

Despite Nitzana was not immediately affected by the Arab conquest in the 7th century, the settlement was abandoned again around 800 AD and felt into ruins. Remaining buildings were used as caravanserai. Parts of the stones were used for house-construction in Gaza.

At around 1900, the Ottomans started to build a police post to serve as a administrative centre in the former settlement Nitzana, now called Hafir el Auja. Parts of the ancient ruins were used to construct buildings for the Ottoman settlement. Within the fort, the Ottomans started approx. in 1906 to construct a serail/palace but due to lack of material and funds only achieved to build a bit more than the foundation. 

In autumn 1914, the Germans and Ottoman planned an advance against the Suez Canal under Ottoman commander Ali Fuad Bey and German chief of staff of the Ottoman VIII. Army Kress von Kressenstein. When Kress von Kressenstein visited the area in October 1914, he noted the ruins of the fortress with the foundation of the palace on the hill, ruins of Byzantine churches and three Ottoman buildings (administrative building, police post and an empty house) in the lower part of the settlement next to ancient wells.

In preparation of the planned German-Ottoman advance against the Suez Canal, wells and water cisterns were built between Be’er Sheva and El Arish as well as simple roads. Further, it was given order to build a hospital on the foundation of the palace located on Tel Nitzana in end of 1914. 

In January 1915, works started to build a road from Hebron to Be’er Sheva in order to improve infrastructure and supply problems. Further, in January 1915, the Ottomans built a military railroad from the Hejaz line (connection Afula/Sileh to Dera’a) to Be’er Sheva.

The first expedition against the Suez Canal started on January 15 until February 13, 1915. The mixed German-Ottoman troops of approx. 25.000 men reached the canal but were not able to hold their positions mainly due to insufficient supply. 

The military railway had reached the newly build Asluj station (some 30 km before Hafir el Auja direction Sinai) in March 1916 and the station was inaugurated by Enver Pasha during his visit in the region. The line reached the station Hafir el Auja in May 1916. Despite these efforts, the efficiency of the line from Afula to Hafir was rather low.

By July 1916, the German-Ottoman hospital was not yet finished but already operating. Earlier, in February or March 1916, 4 Borromean sisters (Christian Sisters of Mercy of St Borromeo) were employed in the hospital as nurses. The Ottomans erected in mid-February 1916 a field hospital (Turkish Red Crescent) in Hafir el Auja in addition to the hospital.

The second advance under Kress von Kressenstein with some 16.000 men in July/August 1916 did not reach the Suez Canal as the Allied had extended their defense positions effectively. The main result for the German-Ottoman effort was the concentration of large Allied forces (Battle of Romani). Among the German-Ottoman troops were 1.600 German soldiers, part of the Imperial German expeditionary forces (Asienkorps). 

The German archaeologist K. Wulzinger made in September 1916 a survey in Auja for the Turko-German Committee for the Preservation of Ancient Monuments and discovered the first Nabatean painted pottery ever found in the Negev.

The Allied forces with superior number of troops, material and supply gained more and more ground (conquering Sinai). El Arish was abandoned in Mid December 1916. After the loss of the Ottoman area in Egypt, Hafir became an outpost-garrison with 4 battalions, 1 machine-gun company and 1 Ottoman mountain-howitzer battery. 

The Allied started to attack Gaza in February 1917. In order to stabilize the front (line Gaza-Tel Sheria-Be’er Sheva), Kressenstein draw its remaining troops from Hafir back to Be’er Sheva in March 1917. Irregular British troops, Bedouins paid by the British, occupied Hafir soon after. According to Kressenstein, certain section of the tracks of the railway line from Hafir el Auja to Quseime were dismantled while the Allied troops were advancing and reused to build a new line from Et Tineh (Kiryat Malachi) to Huj in order to stabilize the supply to the Axis troops in Gaza. 
By end of April 1917 the outpost-garrison of Hafir el Auja was abandoned by the Ottomans. 

On May 8th, 1917, the Venezuelan adventurer Rafael de Nogales became Ottoman military governor of the Ottoman Sinai region. He had been serving in the Ottoman army earlier in Eastern Anatolia and the Iraq. By that time, the Ottomans had given up on the Sinai region. He was assigned an experienced group of Arab camel riders (Hedjin-Suaris), a kind of elite troop, plus an irregular volunteer regiment from El Arish. This regiment was commanded by the Bedouin Sheiks Hassan Erkienharb and Selim who did not wanted to subdue to the British forces in El Arish. The Ottoman target was to restrain the British forces in the area of El Arish, Magdhaba and Quseime (Kuseima). Hafir el Auja and Bir Biren (Birein) were chosen as base during the four weeks expedition. 

At about the same time, Allied troops such as the Camel Brigade and C Squadron, 11th Australian Light Horse Regiment, destroyed sections of the railway line between Hafir and Asluj as well as the station building Asluj during a one-week demolition raid. It is unclear if they also destroyed station buildings at Hafir during this raid.

De Nogales and his men left Be’er Sheva and expelled the British irregular troops from Hafir on May 15th. They started talks with local sheiks in order to regain back their ‘loyalty’. The word spread about their presence and the British sent troops but were unable to localize de Nogales and his Arabs. With the pressure and limited resources, de Nogales knew his days were counted and his men started sabotage attacks. British railway lines at El Arish were blown up and wells at Magdhaba. The Allied response came quickly. In end of May, large numbers of regular British troops started searching for the men forcing de Nogales to retreat to Be’er Sheva. De Nogales and his Arabs were the last Ottoman troops on Egypt territory. As consequence, the British destroyed large sections of the railway between Hafir and Be’er Sheva. This time, on May 23rd, they blew up the big railway bridge at Asluj. It is possible that Ottoman railway buildings at Hafir were blown up as well.
Considering the defensive Ottoman military strategy based on limited resources, both demolition raids did not had an effect on the war. 

Hafir el Auja became part of the British mandate. The former Ottoman garrison Hafir el Auja was used as prison camp until 1948.

According to the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, the area was planned to become part of the Arab state and in 1948 the Egyptian Army used the area and the Ottoman buildings as a military base. Despite this plan Auja was captured in December 1948 by the Israeli 89th Mechanized Commando Battalion in the so called Battle of Auja al-Hafir, part of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. During the fighting, Israeli airplanes bombed the Egypt military base in Auja. Damages of the battle can still be seen in the ruins, e.g. on the old German-Ottoman hospital.

As a result of the Armistice Agreement of 1949, the area around the village became a demilitarized zone (DMZ). Israel re-militarized the area on September 21, 1955, and continued to occupy it until after its withdrawal from Sinai and Gaza in 1956. After this, and until the Six-Day-War, the DMZ and the border were monitored by the United Nations Emergency Force. Those Ottoman buildings which have not already been destroyed in the battle of 1948 were blown up by the Israeli army in September 1956 to prevent UN-troops to return to Nitzana. Of course, to the UN this would not have made much difference. They could have accomodated themselves in tents. Therefore, the destruction was useless. Some ruins and most fundaments are still visible.

      <description>This photograph was taken in Spring 1916 by a German military photographer during the Axis advance against the Suez Canal.  

At around 1900, the Ottomans started to build a police post to serve as a administrative centre in the former settlement Nitzana, now called Hafir el Auja. Parts of the ancient ruins were used to construct buildings for the Ottoman settlement. Within the fort, the Ottomans started approx. in 1906 to construct a serail/palace but due to lack of material and funds only achieved to build a bit more than the foundation. 

In autumn 1914, the Germans and Ottoman planned an advance against the Suez Canal under Ottoman commander Ali Fuad Bey and German chief of staff of the Ottoman VIII. Army Kress von Kressenstein. When Kress von Kressenstein visited the area in October 1914, he noted the ruins of the fortress with the foundation of the palace on the hill, ruins of Byzantine churches and three Ottoman buildings (administrative building, police post and an empty house) in the lower part of the settlement next to ancient wells.

In preparation of the planned German-Ottoman advance against the Suez Canal, wells and water cisterns were built between Be’er Sheva and El Arish as well as simple roads. Further, it was given order to build a hospital on the foundation of the palace located on Tel Nitzana in end of 1914. 

In January 1915, works started to build a road from Hebron to Be’er Sheva in order to improve infrastructure and supply problems. Further, in January 1915, the Ottomans built a military railroad from the Hejaz line (connection Afula/Sileh to Dera’a) to Be’er Sheva.

The first expedition against the Suez Canal started on January 15 until February 13, 1915. The mixed German-Ottoman troops of approx. 25.000 men reached the canal but were not able to hold their positions mainly due to insufficient supply. 

The military railway had reached the newly build Asluj station (some 30 km before Hafir el Auja direction Sinai) in March 1916 and the station was inaugurated by Enver Pasha during his visit in the region. The line reached the station Hafir el Auja in May 1916. Despite these efforts, the efficiency of the line from Afula to Hafir was rather low.

By July 1916, the German-Ottoman hospital was not yet finished but already operating. Earlier, in February or March 1916, 4 Borromean sisters (Christian Sisters of Mercy of St Borromeo) were employed in the hospital as nurses. The Ottomans erected in mid-February 1916 a field hospital (Turkish Red Crescent) in Hafir el Auja in addition to the hospital.

The second advance under Kress von Kressenstein with some 16.000 men in July/August 1916 did not reach the Suez Canal as the Allied had extended their defense positions effectively. The main result for the German-Ottoman effort was the concentration of large Allied forces (Battle of Romani). Among the German-Ottoman troops were 1.600 German soldiers, part of the Imperial German expeditionary forces (Asienkorps). 

The German archaeologist K. Wulzinger made in September 1916 a survey in Auja for the Turko-German Committee for the Preservation of Ancient Monuments and discovered the first Nabatean painted pottery ever found in the Negev.

The Allied forces with superior number of troops, material and supply gained more and more ground (conquering Sinai). El Arish was abandoned in Mid December 1916. After the loss of the Ottoman area in Egypt, Hafir became an outpost-garrison with 4 battalions, 1 machine-gun company and 1 Ottoman mountain-howitzer battery. 

The Allied started to attack Gaza in February 1917. In order to stabilize the front (line Gaza-Tel Sheria-Be’er Sheva), Kressenstein draw its remaining troops from Hafir back to Be’er Sheva in March 1917. Irregular British troops, Bedouins paid by the British, occupied Hafir soon after. According to Kressenstein, certain section of the tracks of the railway line from Hafir el Auja to Quseime were dismantled while the Allied troops were advancing and reused to build a new line from Et Tineh (Kiryat Malachi) to Huj in order to stabilize the supply to the Axis troops in Gaza. 
By end of April 1917 the outpost-garrison of Hafir el Auja was abandoned by the Ottomans. 

On May 8th, 1917, the Venezuelan adventurer Rafael de Nogales became Ottoman military governor of the Ottoman Sinai region. He had been serving in the Ottoman army earlier in Eastern Anatolia and the Iraq. By that time, the Ottomans had given up on the Sinai region. He was assigned an experienced group of Arab camel riders (Hedjin-Suaris), a kind of elite troop, plus an irregular volunteer regiment from El Arish. This regiment was commanded by the Bedouin Sheiks Hassan Erkienharb and Selim who did not wanted to subdue to the British forces in El Arish. The Ottoman target was to restrain the British forces in the area of El Arish, Magdhaba and Quseime (Kuseima). Hafir el Auja and Bir Biren (Birein) were chosen as base during the four weeks expedition. 

At about the same time, Allied troops such as the Camel Brigade and C Squadron, 11th Australian Light Horse Regiment, destroyed sections of the railway line between Hafir and Asluj as well as the station building Asluj during a one-week demolition raid. It is unclear if they also destroyed station buildings at Hafir during this raid.

De Nogales and his men left Be’er Sheva and expelled the British irregular troops from Hafir on May 15th. They started talks with local sheiks in order to regain back their ‘loyalty’. The word spread about their presence and the British sent troops but were unable to localize de Nogales and his Arabs. With the pressure and limited resources, de Nogales knew his days were counted and his men started sabotage attacks. British railway lines at El Arish were blown up and wells at Magdhaba. The Allied response came quickly. In end of May, large numbers of regular British troops started searching for the men forcing de Nogales to retreat to Be’er Sheva. De Nogales and his Arabs were the last Ottoman troops on Egypt territory. As consequence, the British destroyed large sections of the railway between Hafir and Be’er Sheva. This time, on May 23rd, they blew up the big railway bridge at Asluj. It is possible that Ottoman railway buildings at Hafir were blown up as well.
Considering the defensive Ottoman military strategy based on limited resources, both demolition raids did not had an effect on the war. 

Hafir el Auja became part of the British mandate. The former Ottoman garrison Hafir el Auja was used as prison camp until 1948.

According to the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, the area was planned to become part of the Arab state and in 1948 the Egyptian Army used the area and the Ottoman buildings as a military base. Despite this plan Auja was captured in December 1948 by the Israeli 89th Mechanized Commando Battalion in the so called Battle of Auja al-Hafir, part of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. During the fighting, Israeli airplanes bombed the Egypt military base in Auja. Damages of the battle can still be seen in the ruins, e.g. on the old German-Ottoman hospital.

As a result of the Armistice Agreement of 1949, the area around the village became a demilitarized zone (DMZ). Israel re-militarized the area on September 21, 1955, and continued to occupy it until after its withdrawal from Sinai and Gaza in 1956. After this, and until the Six-Day-War, the DMZ and the border were monitored by the United Nations Emergency Force. According to information from an Israeli friend, the Israeli Army had in 1956 no more use for the Ottoman railway buildings and neither of Ottoman village buildings in Hafir. Unless they were not already destroyed in the battle of 1948, all buildings were blown up by the Israeli army. Some ruins are still visible.
Israel has full control of the area since 1967 and changed the name from Hafir el Auja to Nitzana.</description>

      <description>Nitzana was a settlement founded by the Nabateans approx. in the 1st century BC. It is located on the ancient Incense Route, connecting Egypt with Palestine. In the settlement, the Nabateans had built a small fortress on the hill. In 106 AD, when the Nabatean kingdom was annexed by the Romans, the Nabateans abandoned the settlement. 

In the 4th century the place was resettled by the Byzantines. Also during Byzantine times, a church was built on the hill (Tel Nitzana) and the fort was extended including a hostel for pilgrims. Another church was erected in the lower part of the settlement.

Despite Nitzana was not immediately affected by the Arab conquest in the 7th century, the settlement was abandoned again around 800 AD and felt into ruins. Remaining buildings were used as caravanserai. Parts of the stones were used for house-construction in Gaza.

At around 1900, the Ottomans started to build a police post to serve as a administrative centre in the former settlement Nitzana, now called Hafir el Auja. Parts of the ancient ruins were used to construct buildings for the Ottoman settlement. Within the fort, the Ottomans started approx. in 1906 to construct a serail/palace but due to lack of material and funds only achieved to build a bit more than the foundation. 

In autumn 1914, the Germans and Ottoman planned an advance against the Suez Canal under Ottoman commander Ali Fuad Bey and German chief of staff of the Ottoman VIII. Army Kress von Kressenstein. When Kress von Kressenstein visited the area in October 1914, he noted the ruins of the fortress with the foundation of the palace on the hill, ruins of Byzantine churches and three Ottoman buildings (administrative building, police post and an empty house) in the lower part of the settlement next to ancient wells.

In preparation of the planned German-Ottoman advance against the Suez Canal, wells and water cisterns were built between Be’er Sheva and El Arish as well as simple roads. Further, it was given order to build a hospital on the foundation of the palace located on Tel Nitzana in end of 1914. 

In January 1915, works started to build a road from Hebron to Be’er Sheva in order to improve infrastructure and supply problems. Further, in January 1915, the Ottomans built a military railroad from the Hejaz line (connection Afula/Sileh to Dera’a) to Be’er Sheva.

The first expedition against the Suez Canal started on January 15 until February 13, 1915. The mixed German-Ottoman troops of approx. 25.000 men reached the canal but were not able to hold their positions mainly due to insufficient supply. 

The military railway had reached the newly build Asluj station (some 30 km before Hafir el Auja direction Sinai) in March 1916 and the station was inaugurated by Enver Pasha during his visit in the region. The line reached the station Hafir el Auja in May 1916. Despite these efforts, the efficiency of the line from Afula to Hafir was rather low.

By July 1916, the German-Ottoman hospital was not yet finished but already operating. Earlier, in February or March 1916, 4 Borromean sisters (Christian Sisters of Mercy of St Borromeo) were employed in the hospital as nurses. The Ottomans erected in mid-February 1916 a field hospital (Turkish Red Crescent) in Hafir el Auja in addition to the hospital.

By end of April 1917 the outpost-garrison of Hafir el Auja was abandoned by the Ottomans. 

On May 8th, 1917, the Venezuelan adventurer Rafael de Nogales became Ottoman military governor of the Ottoman Sinai region. He had been serving in the Ottoman army earlier in Eastern Anatolia and the Iraq. By that time, the Ottomans had given up on the Sinai region. He was assigned an experienced group of Arab camel riders (Hedjin-Suaris), a kind of elite troop, plus an irregular volunteer regiment from El Arish. This regiment was commanded by the Bedouin Sheiks Hassan Erkienharb and Selim who did not wanted to subdue to the British forces in El Arish. The Ottoman target was to restrain the British forces in the area of El Arish, Magdhaba and Quseime (Kuseima).

It is unclear if they also destroyed station buildings at Hafir during this raid.

Hafir el Auja became part of the British mandate. The former Ottoman garrison Hafir el Auja was used as prison camp until 1948.

According to the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, the area was planned to become part of the Arab state and in 1948 the Egyptian Army used the area and the Ottoman buildings as a military base. Despite this plan Auja was captured in December 1948 by the Israeli 89th Mechanized Commando Battalion in the so called Battle of Auja al-Hafir, part of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. During the fighting, Israeli airplanes bombed the Egypt military base in Auja. Damages of the battle can still be seen in the ruins, e.g. on the old German-Ottoman hospital.

As a result of the Armistice Agreement of 1949, the area around the village became a demilitarized zone (DMZ). Israel re-militarized the area on September 21, 1955, and continued to occupy it until after its withdrawal from Sinai and Gaza in 1956. After this, and until the Six-Day-War, the DMZ and the border were monitored by the United Nations Emergency Force. Those Ottoman buildings which have not already been destroyed in the battle of 1948 were blown up by the Israeli army in September 1956 to prevent UN-troops to return to Nitzana. Of course, to the UN this would not have made much difference. They could have accomodated themselves in tents. Therefore, the destruction was useless. Some ruins and most fundaments are still visible.
Israel has full control of the area since 1967 and changed the name from Hafir el Auja to Nitzana.</description>

      <description>Nitzana was a settlement founded by the Nabateans approx. in the 1st century BC. It is located on the ancient Incense Route, connecting Egypt with Palestine. In the settlement, the Nabateans had built a small fortress on the hill. In 106 AD, when the Nabatean kingdom was annexed by the Romans, the Nabateans abandoned the settlement. 

In the 4th century the place was resettled by the Byzantines. Also during Byzantine times, a church was built on the hill (Tel Nitzana) and the fort was extended including a hostel for pilgrims. Another church was erected in the lower part of the settlement.

Despite Nitzana was not immediately affected by the Arab conquest in the 7th century, the settlement was abandoned again around 800 AD and felt into ruins. Remaining buildings were used as caravanserai. Parts of the stones were used for house-construction in Gaza.

At around 1900, the Ottomans started to build a police post to serve as a administrative centre in the former settlement Nitzana, now called Hafir el Auja. Parts of the ancient ruins were used to construct buildings for the Ottoman settlement. Within the fort, the Ottomans started approx. in 1906 to construct a serail/palace but due to lack of material and funds only achieved to build a bit more than the foundation. 

In autumn 1914, the Germans and Ottoman planned an advance against the Suez Canal under Ottoman commander Ali Fuad Bey and German chief of staff of the Ottoman VIII. Army Kress von Kressenstein. When Kress von Kressenstein visited the area in October 1914, he noted the ruins of the fortress with the foundation of the palace on the hill, ruins of Byzantine churches and three Ottoman buildings (administrative building, police post and an empty house) in the lower part of the settlement next to ancient wells.

In preparation of the planned German-Ottoman advance against the Suez Canal, wells and water cisterns were built between Be’er Sheva and El Arish as well as simple roads. Further, it was given order to build a hospital on the foundation of the palace located on Tel Nitzana in end of 1914. 

In January 1915, works started to build a road from Hebron to Be’er Sheva in order to improve infrastructure and supply problems. Further, in January 1915, the Ottomans built a military railroad from the Hejaz line (connection Afula/Sileh to Dera’a) to Be’er Sheva.

The first expedition against the Suez Canal started on January 15 until February 13, 1915. The mixed German-Ottoman troops of approx. 25.000 men reached the canal but were not able to hold their positions mainly due to insufficient supply. 

The military railway had reached the newly build Asluj station (some 30 km before Hafir el Auja direction Sinai) in March 1916 and the station was inaugurated by Enver Pasha during his visit in the region. The line reached the station Hafir el Auja in May 1916. Despite these efforts, the efficiency of the line from Afula to Hafir was rather low.

By July 1916, the German-Ottoman hospital was not yet finished but already operating. Earlier, in February or March 1916, 4 Borromean sisters (Christian Sisters of Mercy of St Borromeo) were employed in the hospital as nurses. The Ottomans erected in mid-February 1916 a field hospital (Turkish Red Crescent) in Hafir el Auja in addition to the hospital.

The second advance under Kress von Kressenstein with some 16.000 men in July/August 1916 did not reach the Suez Canal as the Allied had extended their defense positions effectively. The main result for the German-Ottoman effort was the concentration of large Allied forces (Battle of Romani). Among the German-Ottoman troops were 1.600 German soldiers, part of the Imperial German expeditionary forces (Asienkorps). 

The German archaeologist K. Wulzinger made in September 1916 a survey in Auja for the Turko-German Committee for the Preservation of Ancient Monuments and discovered the first Nabatean painted pottery ever found in the Negev.

The Allied forces with superior number of troops, material and supply gained more and more ground (conquering Sinai). El Arish was abandoned in Mid December 1916. After the loss of the Ottoman area in Egypt, Hafir became an outpost-garrison with 4 battalions, 1 machine-gun company and 1 Ottoman mountain-howitzer battery. 

The Allied started to attack Gaza in February 1917. In order to stabilize the front (line Gaza-Tel Sheria-Be’er Sheva), Kressenstein draw its remaining troops from Hafir back to Be’er Sheva in March 1917. Irregular British troops, Bedouins paid by the British, occupied Hafir soon after. According to Kressenstein, certain section of the tracks of the railway line from Hafir el Auja to Quseime were dismantled while the Allied troops were advancing and reused to build a new line from Et Tineh (Kiryat Malachi) to Huj in order to stabilize the supply to the Axis troops in Gaza. 
By end of April 1917 the outpost-garrison of Hafir el Auja was abandoned by the Ottomans. 

On May 8th, 1917, the Venezuelan adventurer Rafael de Nogales became Ottoman military governor of the Ottoman Sinai region. He had been serving in the Ottoman army earlier in Eastern Anatolia and the Iraq. By that time, the Ottomans had given up on the Sinai region. He was assigned an experienced group of Arab camel riders (Hedjin-Suaris), a kind of elite troop, plus an irregular volunteer regiment from El Arish. This regiment was commanded by the Bedouin Sheiks Hassan Erkienharb and Selim who did not wanted to subdue to the British forces in El Arish. The Ottoman target was to restrain the British forces in the area of El Arish, Magdhaba and Quseime (Kuseima). Hafir el Auja and Bir Biren (Birein) were chosen as base during the four weeks expedition. 

At about the same time, Allied troops such as the Camel Brigade and C Squadron, 11th Australian Light Horse Regiment, destroyed sections of the railway line between Hafir and Asluj as well as the station building Asluj during a one-week demolition raid. It is unclear if they also destroyed station buildings at Hafir during this raid.

De Nogales and his men left Be’er Sheva and expelled the British irregular troops from Hafir on May 15th. They started talks with local sheiks in order to regain back their ‘loyalty’. The word spread about their presence and the British sent troops but were unable to localize de Nogales and his Arabs. With the pressure and limited resources, de Nogales knew his days were counted and his men started sabotage attacks. British railway lines at El Arish were blown up and wells at Magdhaba. The Allied response came quickly. In end of May, large numbers of regular British troops started searching for the men forcing de Nogales to retreat to Be’er Sheva. De Nogales and his Arabs were the last Ottoman troops on Egypt territory. As consequence, the British destroyed large sections of the railway between Hafir and Be’er Sheva. This time, on May 23rd, they blew up the big railway bridge at Asluj. It is possible that Ottoman railway buildings at Hafir were blown up as well.
Considering the defensive Ottoman military strategy based on limited resources, both demolition raids did not had an effect on the war. 

Hafir el Auja became part of the British mandate. The former Ottoman garrison Hafir el Auja was used as prison camp until 1948.

According to the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, the area was planned to become part of the Arab state and in 1948 the Egyptian Army used the area and the Ottoman buildings as a military base.

      <description>This photograph was probably taken in April 1916 by a German military photographer. It shows an Arab/Ottoman caravan at the well of Bir Asluj village during the Austrian/German/Ottoman advance against the Suez Canal. 
The Arab village of Bir Asluj does not exist anymore. It was either heavily damaged during the Arab-Israeli war in 1948 or the village was destroyed after the fighting in December 1948 (different sources, different information). Today, some of the ground where the village used to be is part of the Golda Meir Park at Mash'abim.</description>

As you can see, the station building was not yet finished. 

The station was blown up by Camel Brigade and C Squadron, 11th Australian Light Horse Regiment, who also destroyed sections of the railway line between Hafir el Auja and Bir Asluj during a one-week demolition raid in early or mid May 1917.

      <description>Tel Be'er Sheva is an archeological site believed to be the remains of the biblical town of Be'er Sheva.  
 
The town is mentioned numerous times in the Tanakh, often as a means of describing the extent of the Land of Israel, as being from &amp;quot;Be'er Sheva to Dan&amp;quot;. For examples, see Judges 20:1-3 and I Samuel 3:19-21. The name is derived from the Hebrew Be'er meaning a well, and Sheva, meaning either the number seven, or &amp;quot;to swear an oath&amp;quot;.
 
Archeological finds indicate that the site was used from the Chalcolithic period, around 4000 BCE, through to the sixteenth century CE. This was probably due to the abundance of underground water, as evidenced by the numerous wells in the area. The settlement itself dates from the early Israelite period, around the tenth century BCE.
  
A large horned altar was uncovered at the site. It was reconstructed with several well-dressed stones found in secondary use in the walls of a later building. This altar attests to the existence of a temple or cult center in the city which was probably dismantled during the reforms of King Hezekiah. (2 Kings 18:4)

Tel Be’er Sheva is part of the Israeli UNESCO World Heritage sites.

During WW1, Be’er Sheva played an important role in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of the Allied Forces. As part of the 3rd Battle for Gaza and the, General Allenby's troops breached the line of Turkish defense between Gaza and Be’er Sheva On October 31, 1917. 800 soldiers of the Australian 4th and 12th Regiments of the 4th Light Horse Brigade with only horses and bayonets, charged the Turkish trenches, overran them and captured the important wells of Be’er Sheva in what has become known as the &amp;quot;last successful cavalry charge in British military history.&amp;quot; 
The Ottomans defended bravely but the Allied forces were superior. The defence included Tel Be’er Sheva on which 1 Infantry battalion of 300 Ottomans with 6 machine guns was stationed. These men occupied 2 British cavalry divsions for six hours allowing time for the retreat to Tel Sheria and saving scarce equipment. In total, the Allied lost for the conquest of Be’er Shevea 136 men with more than 1.000 injured. On Ottoman side, 281 Turkish soldiers died.</description>

      <description>Picture taken by a German photographer probably 1916 who was part of the German Expeditionary Corps (Asienkorps) during their way to the Suez Canal. 

Here is some background history:
Human settlement in the area date from the Copper Age. The region has probably been inhabited since the 4th millennium BC. The city has been destroyed and rebuilt many times over the centuries.
Israelites founded the city of Be’er Sheva during the 10th century BC after the land was conquered by King David (Tel Be’er Sheva). The site was probably chosen due to the abundance of water. According to the Bible, the wells were dug by Abraham and Issac. Be’er Sheva is mentioned several times in the Bible. Tel Be’er Sheva is part of the Israeli UNESCO World Heritage sites.
Following the Babylonian conquest and subsequent enslavement of many Israelites, the town was abandoned but resettled after the slaves returned from Babylon.
During the Roman and later Byzantine periods, the town served as a front-line defense against Nabatean attacks. The last inhabitants of Tel Be'er-Sheva were the Byzantines, who abandoned the city during the Arab conquest of Palestine in the 7th century.

The Ottomans, who had controlled Palestine since the 16th century, took no interest in Be’er Sheva until the end of the 19th century. At the beginning of the 19th century, Be’er Sheva was portrayed by European pilgrims as a barren stretch of land with a well and a handful of Bedouins living nearby. Towards the end of the 19th century, the Ottomans built a police station in Be’er Sheva. 
A town plan was created by a Swiss and a German architect with a grid street pattern. Most of the residents at the time were Arabs from Hebron and the Gaza area, although Jews also began settling in the city. 

In Autumn 1914, the Germans and Ottoman planned an advance against the Suez canal under Ottoman commander Ali Fuad Bey and German chief of staff of the Ottoman VIII. Army Kress von Kressenstein. Be’er Sheva was chosen as main back area for the German and Ottoman troops due to its abundance of water. The supply for the troops had to be transported from Damascus via Nablus and Jerusalem on camel caravans which was absolutely insufficient. By early October 1914 there was no road existing to connect Jerusalem with Be’er Sheva. In January 1915, the German-Ottoman military headquarter for the Suez expedition was estabilshed in Be’er Sheva. At about the same time, works started to build a road from Hebron to Be’er Sheva in order to improve infrastructure and supply problems. Further, in January 1915, the Ottomans built a military railroad from the Hejaz line (connection Afula/Sileh to Dera’a) to Be’er Sheva. 

The first expedition against the Suez canal started on January 15 until February 13, 1915. The mixed German-Ottoman troops of approx. 25.000 men reached the canal but were not able to hold their positions mainly due to insufficient supply. Afterwards, a new expedition was planned and preparations were made. The railway was extended until Be’er Sheva and the train station was inaugurated on October 30, 1915. The celebration was attended by the Turkish army commander Jemal (Djemal) Pasha. The line was later extended to Hafir el Auja. By January 1916, the Ottomans had errected army repairshops. Earlier, all major repairs had to be made in Jaffa or Jerusalem. Further, a hospital was build in Be’er Sheva where 10 Kaiserwerth deaconesses were working. Two German nurses were working in the soldier’s home in the city. In March 1916 Enver Pasha was visiting the troops in Be’er Sheva and he used the occasion to inaugurate the new train station in Asluj.

In April 1916, the German flying detachment (Fliegerabteilung) 300 arrived in Be’er Sheva and in mid April an Austrian/Hungarian artillery division. Both units were inspected by Jemal Pasha in end of May 1916. An airfield was build in Be’er sheva which was already attacked by British planes in June 1916. On Juli 4, the Austrian/German and Ottoman troops left Be’er Sheva for El Arish as collecting point for the second advance against the Suez canal. The attack started on August 3 with approx. 16.000 men and lasted until August 14 (Battle of Romani).

The Allied forces with superior material and supply gained more and more ground (conquering Sinai). Due to the Allied pressure, El Arish was abandoned in Mid December 1916 and the German planes were removed from Be’er Sheva to Ramle in January 1917. The Allied started to attack Gaza in February 1917. In order to stabilize the front, Kressenstein draw its remaining troops from the Sinai back to Be’er Sheva in March 1917. Be’er Sheva was considered the gate to Jerusalem. By September 1917, more and more troops were stationed in Be’er Sheva such as the 3rd Ottoman Cavalry Division and the 27th Infantry Division under Colonel Ibrahim Bey enforced by the 1st Regt. of the 16th Division with 3 batteries and parts of the 24th Division. The defence of Be’er Sheva was coordinated by colonel Ismed Bey.

Due to its strategic position, Be’er Sheva played an important role in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of the Allied Forces. As part of the 3rd Battle for Gaza and the, General Allenby's troops breached the line of Turkish defense between Gaza and Be’er Sheva On October 31, 1917. 800 soldiers of the Australian 4th and 12th Regiments of the 4th Light Horse Brigade with only horses and bayonets, charged the Turkish trenches, overran them and captured the important wells of Be’er Sheva in what has become known as the &amp;quot;last successful cavalry charge in British military history.&amp;quot; 
The Ottomans defended bravely but the Allied forces were superior. The defence included Tel Be’er Sheva on which 1 Infantry battalion of 300 Ottomans with 6 machine guns was stationed. These men occupied 2 British cavalry divsions for six hours allowing time for the retreat to Tel Sheria and saving scarce equipment. In total, the Allied lost for the conquest of Be’er Shevea 136 men with more than 1.000 injured. On Ottoman side, 281 Turkish soldiers died.

On the edge of Be’er Sheva's Old City is a Commonwealth cemetery. The Turkish government errected nearby the train station a memorial stone for the fallen Ottoman soldiers. In the Sinai there exists no Ottoman war cemetary. The fallen Germans were brought in the 1930’s to the central German war cemetary in Nazareth if it was possible to locate and identify their graves. A statue of Allenby was errected within the remains of the old Ottoman central square.

Be’er Sheva was a major administrative center during the period of the British Mandate for Palestine. A railway was constructed between Rafah and Be’er Sheva in October 1917; it opened to the public in May 1918, serving the Negev and settlements south of Mount Hebron. In 1928, at the beginning of the tension between the Jews and the Arabs over Palestine, wide-scale riots broke out which left 133 Jews dead and 339 wounded, many Jews abandoned Be’er Sheva. After an Arab attack on a Jewish bus in 1936, which escalated into the 1936-1939 Arab revolt in Palestine, the remaining Jews left.

The 1947 UN Partition Plan included Beersheba in the territory alotted to the proposed Arab state as the city's population of 4,000 was primarily Arab. The Egyptian army was stationed in Be’er Sheva in May 1948.

During the Israeli Independence War, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion gave the green light for the city to be conquered. Israeli Air Force bombing raids began during the night of October 18/19, 1948. The Arab residents fled en masse the next day on foot and in buses. More bombing raids followed that night, and on October 21 the 8th Brigade's 89th battalion and the Negev Brigade’s 7th and 9th battalions moved in. The Egyptian forces were surrounded and Be’er Sheva was soon in Israeli hands. Around 120 Egyptian soldiers were taken prisoner, and the remaining civilians, 200 men and 150 women and children, were taken to the police fort. On October 25, the women, children, disabled, and elderly were driven by truck to the Gaza border. 

Today, Be’er Sheva is a rather peaceful place with many Russian immigrants. Occasionally, Palestinian Hamas send rockets and cause destruction such as in mid of March 2011.

      <description>Tel Be'er Sheva is an archeological site believed to be the remains of the biblical town of Be'er Sheva.  
 
The town is mentioned numerous times in the Tanakh, often as a means of describing the extent of the Land of Israel, as being from &amp;quot;Be'er Sheva to Dan&amp;quot;. For examples, see Judges 20:1-3 and I Samuel 3:19-21. The name is derived from the Hebrew Be'er meaning a well, and Sheva, meaning either the number seven, or &amp;quot;to swear an oath&amp;quot;.
 
Archeological finds indicate that the site was used from the Chalcolithic period, around 4000 BCE, through to the sixteenth century CE. This was probably due to the abundance of underground water, as evidenced by the numerous wells in the area. The settlement itself dates from the early Israelite period, around the tenth century BCE.
  
A large horned altar was uncovered at the site. It was reconstructed with several well-dressed stones found in secondary use in the walls of a later building. This altar attests to the existence of a temple or cult center in the city which was probably dismantled during the reforms of King Hezekiah. (2 Kings 18:4)
 
Tel Be’er Sheva is part of the Israeli UNESCO World Heritage sites.

      <description>The train station at Be'er Sheva was part of the line from Afula to the Sinai and inaugurated on October 30, 1915. The celebration was attended by the Turkish army commander Jemal (Djemal) Pasha. 

The Turkish memorial was errected to honour the 298 Ottoman soldiers who had died around here. Their tombs got lost in time, if they had a tomb at all. In view of the well cared Allied war cemetary, this speaks volumes.

Here is some more background to what had happened here:
In Autumn 1914, the Germans and Ottomans planned an advance against the Suez canal under Ottoman commander Ali Fuad Bey and German chief of staff of the Ottoman VIII. Army Kress von Kressenstein. Be’er Sheva was chosen as main back area for the German and Ottoman troops due to its abundance of water. The supply for the troops had to be transported from Damascus via Nablus and Jerusalem on camel caravans which was absolutely insufficient. By early October 1914 there was no road existing to connect Jerusalem with Be’er Sheva. In January 1915, the German-Ottoman military headquarter for the Suez expedition was estabilshed in Be’er Sheva. At about the same time, works started to build a road from Hebron to Be’er Sheva in order to improve infrastructure and supply problems. Further, in January 1915, the Ottomans built a military railroad from the Hejaz line (connection Afula/Sileh to Dera’a) to Be’er Sheva. 

The first expedition against the Suez canal started on January 15 until February 13, 1915. The mixed German-Ottoman troops of approx. 25.000 men reached the canal but were not able to hold their positions mainly due to insufficient supply. Afterwards, a new expedition was planned and preparations were made. The railway was extended until Be’er Sheva and the train station was inaugurated on October 30, 1915. The celebration was attended by the Turkish army commander Jemal (Djemal) Pasha. The line was later extended to Hafir el Auja. By January 1916, the Ottomans had errected army repairshops. Earlier, all major repairs had to be made in Jaffa or Jerusalem. Further, a hospital was build in Be’er Sheva where 10 Kaiserwerth deaconesses were working. Two German nurses were working in the soldier’s home in the city. In March 1916 Enver Pasha was visiting the troops in Be’er Sheva and he used the occasion to inaugurate the new train station in Asluj.

In April 1916, the German flying detachment (Fliegerabteilung) 300 arrived in Be’er Sheva and in mid April an Austrian/Hungarian artillery division. Both units were inspected by Jemal Pasha in end of May 1916. An airfield was build in Be’er sheva which was already attacked by British planes in June 1916. On Juli 4, the Austrian/German and Ottoman troops left Be’er Sheva for El Arish as collecting point for the second advance against the Suez canal. The attack started on August 3 with approx. 16.000 men and lasted until August 14 (Battle of Romani).

The Allied forces with superior material and supply gained more and more ground (conquering Sinai). Due to the Allied pressure, El Arish was abandoned in Mid December 1916 and the German planes were removed from Be’er Sheva to Ramle in January 1917. The Allied started to attack Gaza in February 1917. In order to stabilize the front, Kressenstein draw its remaining troops from the Sinai back to Be’er Sheva in March 1917. Be’er Sheva was considered the gate to Jerusalem. By September 1917, more and more troops were stationed in Be’er Sheva such as the 3rd Ottoman Cavalry Division and the 27th Infantry Division under Colonel Ibrahim Bey enforced by the 1st Regt. of the 16th Division with 3 batteries and parts of the 24th Division. The defence of Be’er Sheva was coordinated by colonel Ismed Bey.

Due to its strategic position, Be’er Sheva played an important role in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of the Allied Forces. As part of the 3rd Battle for Gaza and the, General Allenby's troops breached the line of Turkish defense between Gaza and Be’er Sheva On October 31, 1917. 800 soldiers of the Australian 4th and 12th Regiments of the 4th Light Horse Brigade with only horses and bayonets, charged the Turkish trenches, overran them and captured the important wells of Be’er Sheva in what has become known as the &amp;quot;last successful cavalry charge in British military history.&amp;quot; 
The Ottomans defended bravely but the Allied forces were superior. The defence included Tel Be’er Sheva on which 1 Infantry battalion of 300 Ottomans with 6 machine guns was stationed. These men occupied 2 British cavalry divsions for six hours allowing time for the retreat to Tel Sheria and saving scarce equipment. In total, the Allied lost for the conquest of Be’er Shevea 136 men with more than 1.000 injured. On Ottoman side, 281 Turkish soldiers died (the difference to the 298 are either due to missing soldiers or those who died after the battle).

On the edge of Be’er Sheva's Old City is a Commonwealth cemetery. The Turkish government errected nearby the train station a memorial stone for the fallen Ottoman soldiers. In the Sinai there exists no Ottoman war cemetary. The fallen Germans were brought in the 1930’s to the central German war cemetary in Nazareth if it was possible to locate and identify their graves.

The green (in the desert area) cemetary is well frequented by British and Australian tourists.</description>

      <description>Picture taken by a German photographer probably 1916 who was attached to German Flying Detachment 300 (Fliegerabteilung 300), part of the German Expeditionary Corps (Asienkorps). The picture probably shows the inspection by Jemal Pasha before the second advance against the Suez Canal. 

Here is some background history:
Human settlement in the area date from the Copper Age. The region has probably been inhabited since the 4th millennium BC. The city has been destroyed and rebuilt many times over the centuries.
Israelites founded the city of Be’er Sheva during the 10th century BC after the land was conquered by King David (Tel Be’er Sheva). The site was probably chosen due to the abundance of water. According to the Bible, the wells were dug by Abraham and Issac. Be’er Sheva is mentioned several times in the Bible. Tel Be’er Sheva is part of the Israeli UNESCO World Heritage sites.
Following the Babylonian conquest and subsequent enslavement of many Israelites, the town was abandoned but resettled after the slaves returned from Babylon.
During the Roman and later Byzantine periods, the town served as a front-line defense against Nabatean attacks. The last inhabitants of Tel Be'er-Sheva were the Byzantines, who abandoned the city during the Arab conquest of Palestine in the 7th century.

The Ottomans, who had controlled Palestine since the 16th century, took no interest in Be’er Sheva until the end of the 19th century. At the beginning of the 19th century, Be’er Sheva was portrayed by European pilgrims as a barren stretch of land with a well and a handful of Bedouins living nearby. Towards the end of the 19th century, the Ottomans built a police station in Be’er Sheva. 
A town plan was created by a Swiss and a German architect with a grid street pattern. Most of the residents at the time were Arabs from Hebron and the Gaza area, although Jews also began settling in the city. 

In Autumn 1914, the Germans and Ottoman planned an advance against the Suez canal under Ottoman commander Ali Fuad Bey and German chief of staff of the Ottoman VIII. Army Kress von Kressenstein. Be’er Sheva was chosen as main back area for the German and Ottoman troops due to its abundance of water. The supply for the troops had to be transported from Damascus via Nablus and Jerusalem on camel caravans which was absolutely insufficient. By early October 1914 there was no road existing to connect Jerusalem with Be’er Sheva. In January 1915, the German-Ottoman military headquarter for the Suez expedition was estabilshed in Be’er Sheva. At about the same time, works started to build a road from Hebron to Be’er Sheva in order to improve infrastructure and supply problems. Further, in January 1915, the Ottomans built a military railroad from the Hejaz line (connection Afula/Sileh to Dera’a) to Be’er Sheva. 

The first expedition against the Suez canal started on January 15 until February 13, 1915. The mixed German-Ottoman troops of approx. 25.000 men reached the canal but were not able to hold their positions mainly due to insufficient supply. Afterwards, a new expedition was planned and preparations were made. The railway was extended until Be’er Sheva and the train station was inaugurated on October 30, 1915. The celebration was attended by the Turkish army commander Jemal (Djemal) Pasha. The line was later extended to Hafir el Auja. By January 1916, the Ottomans had errected army repairshops. Earlier, all major repairs had to be made in Jaffa or Jerusalem. Further, a hospital was build in Be’er Sheva where 10 Kaiserwerth deaconesses were working. Two German nurses were working in the soldier’s home in the city. In March 1916 Enver Pasha was visiting the troops in Be’er Sheva and he used the occasion to inaugurate the new train station in Asluj.

In April 1916, the German flying detachment (Fliegerabteilung) 300 arrived in Be’er Sheva and in mid April an Austrian/Hungarian artillery division. Both units were inspected by Jemal Pasha in end of May 1916. An airfield was build in Be’er sheva which was already attacked by British planes in June 1916. On Juli 4, the Austrian/German and Ottoman troops left Be’er Sheva for El Arish as collecting point for the second advance against the Suez canal. The attack started on August 3 with approx. 16.000 men and lasted until August 14 (Battle of Romani).

The Allied forces with superior material and supply gained more and more ground (conquering Sinai). Due to the Allied pressure, El Arish was abandoned in Mid December 1916 and the German planes were removed from Be’er Sheva to Ramle in January 1917. The Allied started to attack Gaza in February 1917. In order to stabilize the front, Kressenstein draw its remaining troops from the Sinai back to Be’er Sheva in March 1917. Be’er Sheva was considered the gate to Jerusalem. By September 1917, more and more troops were stationed in Be’er Sheva such as the 3rd Ottoman Cavalry Division and the 27th Infantry Division under Colonel Ibrahim Bey enforced by the 1st Regt. of the 16th Division with 3 batteries and parts of the 24th Division. The defence of Be’er Sheva was coordinated by colonel Ismed Bey.

Due to its strategic position, Be’er Sheva played an important role in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of the Allied Forces. As part of the 3rd Battle for Gaza and the, General Allenby's troops breached the line of Turkish defense between Gaza and Be’er Sheva On October 31, 1917. 800 soldiers of the Australian 4th and 12th Regiments of the 4th Light Horse Brigade with only horses and bayonets, charged the Turkish trenches, overran them and captured the important wells of Be’er Sheva in what has become known as the &amp;quot;last successful cavalry charge in British military history.&amp;quot; 
The Ottomans defended bravely but the Allied forces were superior. The defence included Tel Be’er Sheva on which 1 Infantry battalion of 300 Ottomans with 6 machine guns was stationed. These men occupied 2 British cavalry divsions for six hours allowing time for the retreat to Tel Sheria and saving scarce equipment. In total, the Allied lost for the conquest of Be’er Shevea 136 men with more than 1.000 injured. On Ottoman side, 281 Turkish soldiers died.

On the edge of Be’er Sheva's Old City is a Commonwealth cemetery. The Turkish government errected nearby the train station a memorial stone for the fallen Ottoman soldiers. In the Sinai there exists no Ottoman war cemetary. The fallen Germans were brought in the 1930’s to the central German war cemetary in Nazareth if it was possible to locate and identify their graves. A statue of Allenby was errected within the remains of the old Ottoman central square.

Be’er Sheva was a major administrative center during the period of the British Mandate for Palestine. A railway was constructed between Rafah and Be’er Sheva in October 1917; it opened to the public in May 1918, serving the Negev and settlements south of Mount Hebron. In 1928, at the beginning of the tension between the Jews and the Arabs over Palestine, wide-scale riots broke out which left 133 Jews dead and 339 wounded, many Jews abandoned Be’er Sheva. After an Arab attack on a Jewish bus in 1936, which escalated into the 1936-1939 Arab revolt in Palestine, the remaining Jews left.

The 1947 UN Partition Plan included Beersheba in the territory alotted to the proposed Arab state as the city's population of 4,000 was primarily Arab. The Egyptian army was stationed in Be’er Sheva in May 1948.

During the Israeli Independence War, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion gave the green light for the city to be conquered. Israeli Air Force bombing raids began during the night of October 18/19, 1948. The Arab residents fled en masse the next day on foot and in buses. More bombing raids followed that night, and on October 21 the 8th Brigade's 89th battalion and the Negev Brigade’s 7th and 9th battalions moved in. The Egyptian forces were surrounded and Be’er Sheva was soon in Israeli hands. Around 120 Egyptian soldiers were taken prisoner, and the remaining civilians, 200 men and 150 women and children, were taken to the police fort. On October 25, the women, children, disabled, and elderly were driven by truck to the Gaza border. 

Today, Be’er Sheva is a rather peaceful place with many Russian immigrants. Occasionally, Palestinian Hamas send rockets and cause destruction such as in mid of March 2011.

      <description>Picture taken from the minaret of the old mosque by a German photographer probably 1915/1916 attached to German Flying Detachment 300 (Fliegerabteilung 300), part of the German Expeditionary Corps (Asienkorps).

Here is some background history:
Human settlement in the area date from the Copper Age. The region has probably been inhabited since the 4th millennium BC. The city has been destroyed and rebuilt many times over the centuries.
Israelites founded the city of Be’er Sheva during the 10th century BC after the land was conquered by King David (Tel Be’er Sheva). The site was probably chosen due to the abundance of water. According to the Bible, the wells were dug by Abraham and Issac. Be’er Sheva is mentioned several times in the Bible. Tel Be’er Sheva is part of the Israeli UNESCO World Heritage sites.
Following the Babylonian conquest and subsequent enslavement of many Israelites, the town was abandoned but resettled after the slaves returned from Babylon.
During the Roman and later Byzantine periods, the town served as a front-line defense against Nabatean attacks. The last inhabitants of Tel Be'er-Sheva were the Byzantines, who abandoned the city during the Arab conquest of Palestine in the 7th century.

The Ottomans, who had controlled Palestine since the 16th century, took no interest in Be’er Sheva until the end of the 19th century. At the beginning of the 19th century, Be’er Sheva was portrayed by European pilgrims as a barren stretch of land with a well and a handful of Bedouins living nearby. Towards the end of the 19th century, the Ottomans built a police station in Be’er Sheva. 
A town plan was created by a Swiss and a German architect with a grid street pattern. Most of the residents at the time were Arabs from Hebron and the Gaza area, although Jews also began settling in the city. 

In Autumn 1914, the Germans and Ottoman planned an advance against the Suez canal under Ottoman commander Ali Fuad Bey and German chief of staff of the Ottoman VIII. Army Kress von Kressenstein. Be’er Sheva was chosen as main back area for the German and Ottoman troops due to its abundance of water. The supply for the troops had to be transported from Damascus via Nablus and Jerusalem on camel caravans which was absolutely insufficient. By early October 1914 there was no road existing to connect Jerusalem with Be’er Sheva. In January 1915, the German-Ottoman military headquarter for the Suez expedition was estabilshed in Be’er Sheva. At about the same time, works started to build a road from Hebron to Be’er Sheva in order to improve infrastructure and supply problems. Further, in January 1915, the Ottomans built a military railroad from the Hejaz line (connection Afula/Sileh to Dera’a) to Be’er Sheva. 

The first expedition against the Suez canal started on January 15 until February 13, 1915. The mixed German-Ottoman troops of approx. 25.000 men reached the canal but were not able to hold their positions mainly due to insufficient supply. Afterwards, a new expedition was planned and preparations were made. The railway was extended until Be’er Sheva and the train station was inaugurated on October 30, 1915. The celebration was attended by the Turkish army commander Jemal (Djemal) Pasha. The line was later extended to Hafir el Auja. By January 1916, the Ottomans had errected army repairshops. Earlier, all major repairs had to be made in Jaffa or Jerusalem. Further, a hospital was build in Be’er Sheva where 10 Kaiserwerth deaconesses were working. Two German nurses were working in the soldier’s home in the city. In March 1916 Enver Pasha was visiting the troops in Be’er Sheva and he used the occasion to inaugurate the new train station in Asluj.

In April 1916, the German flying detachment (Fliegerabteilung) 300 arrived in Be’er Sheva and in mid April an Austrian/Hungarian artillery division. Both units were inspected by Jemal Pasha in end of May 1916. An airfield was build in Be’er sheva which was already attacked by British planes in June 1916. On Juli 4, the Austrian/German and Ottoman troops left Be’er Sheva for El Arish as collecting point for the second advance against the Suez canal. The attack started on August 3 with approx. 16.000 men and lasted until August 14 (Battle of Romani).

The Allied forces with superior material and supply gained more and more ground (conquering Sinai). Due to the Allied pressure, El Arish was abandoned in Mid December 1916 and the German planes were removed from Be’er Sheva to Ramle in January 1917. The Allied started to attack Gaza in February 1917. In order to stabilize the front, Kressenstein draw its remaining troops from the Sinai back to Be’er Sheva in March 1917. Be’er Sheva was considered the gate to Jerusalem. By September 1917, more and more troops were stationed in Be’er Sheva such as the 3rd Ottoman Cavalry Division and the 27th Infantry Division under Colonel Ibrahim Bey enforced by the 1st Regt. of the 16th Division with 3 batteries and parts of the 24th Division. The defence of Be’er Sheva was coordinated by colonel Ismed Bey.

Due to its strategic position, Be’er Sheva played an important role in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of the Allied Forces. As part of the 3rd Battle for Gaza and the, General Allenby's troops breached the line of Turkish defense between Gaza and Be’er Sheva On October 31, 1917. 800 soldiers of the Australian 4th and 12th Regiments of the 4th Light Horse Brigade with only horses and bayonets, charged the Turkish trenches, overran them and captured the important wells of Be’er Sheva in what has become known as the &amp;quot;last successful cavalry charge in British military history.&amp;quot; 
The Ottomans defended bravely but the Allied forces were superior. The defence included Tel Be’er Sheva on which 1 Infantry battalion of 300 Ottomans with 6 machine guns was stationed. These men occupied 2 British cavalry divsions for six hours allowing time for the retreat to Tel Sheria and saving scarce equipment. In total, the Allied lost for the conquest of Be’er Shevea 136 men with more than 1.000 injured. On Ottoman side, 281 Turkish soldiers died.

On the edge of Be’er Sheva's Old City is a Commonwealth cemetery. The Turkish government errected nearby the train station a memorial stone for the fallen Ottoman soldiers. In the Sinai there exists no Ottoman war cemetary. The fallen Germans were brought in the 1930’s to the central German war cemetary in Nazareth if it was possible to locate and identify their graves. A statue of Allenby was errected within the remains of the old Ottoman central square.

Be’er Sheva was a major administrative center during the period of the British Mandate for Palestine. A railway was constructed between Rafah and Be’er Sheva in October 1917; it opened to the public in May 1918, serving the Negev and settlements south of Mount Hebron. In 1928, at the beginning of the tension between the Jews and the Arabs over Palestine, wide-scale riots broke out which left 133 Jews dead and 339 wounded, many Jews abandoned Be’er Sheva. After an Arab attack on a Jewish bus in 1936, which escalated into the 1936-1939 Arab revolt in Palestine, the remaining Jews left.

The 1947 UN Partition Plan included Beersheba in the territory alotted to the proposed Arab state as the city's population of 4,000 was primarily Arab. The Egyptian army was stationed in Be’er Sheva in May 1948.

During the Israeli Independence War, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion gave the green light for the city to be conquered. Israeli Air Force bombing raids began during the night of October 18/19, 1948. The Arab residents fled en masse the next day on foot and in buses. More bombing raids followed that night, and on October 21 the 8th Brigade's 89th battalion and the Negev Brigade’s 7th and 9th battalions moved in. The Egyptian forces were surrounded and Be’er Sheva was soon in Israeli hands. Around 120 Egyptian soldiers were taken prisoner, and the remaining civilians, 200 men and 150 women and children, were taken to the police fort. On October 25, the women, children, disabled, and elderly were driven by truck to the Gaza border. 

Today, Be’er Sheva is a rather peaceful place with many Russian immigrants. Occasionally, Palestinian Hamas send rockets and cause destruction such as in mid of March 2011.

On October 25, the women, children, disabled, and elderly were driven by truck to the Gaza border. 

Today, Be’er Sheva is a rather peaceful place with many Russian immigrants. Occasionally, Palestinian Hamas send rockets and cause destruction such as in mid of March 2011.

      <description>Picture taken by a German photographer probably 1915/1916 attached to German Flying Detachment 300 (Fliegerabteilung 300), part of the German Expeditionary Corps (Asienkorps).

Here is some background history:
Human settlement in the area date from the Copper Age. The region has probably been inhabited since the 4th millennium BC. The city has been destroyed and rebuilt many times over the centuries.
Israelites founded the city of Be’er Sheva during the 10th century BC after the land was conquered by King David (Tel Be’er Sheva). The site was probably chosen due to the abundance of water. According to the Bible, the wells were dug by Abraham and Issac. Be’er Sheva is mentioned several times in the Bible. Tel Be’er Sheva is part of the Israeli UNESCO World Heritage sites.
Following the Babylonian conquest and subsequent enslavement of many Israelites, the town was abandoned but resettled after the slaves returned from Babylon.
During the Roman and later Byzantine periods, the town served as a front-line defense against Nabatean attacks. The last inhabitants of Tel Be'er-Sheva were the Byzantines, who abandoned the city during the Arab conquest of Palestine in the 7th century.

The Ottomans, who had controlled Palestine since the 16th century, took no interest in Be’er Sheva until the end of the 19th century. At the beginning of the 19th century, Be’er Sheva was portrayed by European pilgrims as a barren stretch of land with a well and a handful of Bedouins living nearby. Towards the end of the 19th century, the Ottomans built a police station in Be’er Sheva. 
A town plan was created by a Swiss and a German architect with a grid street pattern. Most of the residents at the time were Arabs from Hebron and the Gaza area, although Jews also began settling in the city. 

In Autumn 1914, the Germans and Ottoman planned an advance against the Suez canal under Ottoman commander Ali Fuad Bey and German chief of staff of the Ottoman VIII. Army Kress von Kressenstein. Be’er Sheva was chosen as main back area for the German and Ottoman troops due to its abundance of water. The supply for the troops had to be transported from Damascus via Nablus and Jerusalem on camel caravans which was absolutely insufficient. By early October 1914 there was no road existing to connect Jerusalem with Be’er Sheva. In January 1915, the German-Ottoman military headquarter for the Suez expedition was estabilshed in Be’er Sheva. At about the same time, works started to build a road from Hebron to Be’er Sheva in order to improve infrastructure and supply problems. Further, in January 1915, the Ottomans built a military railroad from the Hejaz line (connection Afula/Sileh to Dera’a) to Be’er Sheva. 

The first expedition against the Suez canal started on January 15 until February 13, 1915. The mixed German-Ottoman troops of approx. 25.000 men reached the canal but were not able to hold their positions mainly due to insufficient supply. Afterwards, a new expedition was planned and preparations were made. The railway was extended until Be’er Sheva and the train station was inaugurated on October 30, 1915. The celebration was attended by the Turkish army commander Jemal (Djemal) Pasha. The line was later extended to Hafir el Auja. By January 1916, the Ottomans had errected army repairshops. Earlier, all major repairs had to be made in Jaffa or Jerusalem. Further, a hospital was build in Be’er Sheva where 10 Kaiserwerth deaconesses were working. Two German nurses were working in the soldier’s home in the city. In March 1916 Enver Pasha was visiting the troops in Be’er Sheva and he used the occasion to inaugurate the new train station in Asluj.

In April 1916, the German flying detachment (Fliegerabteilung) 300 arrived in Be’er Sheva and in mid April an Austrian/Hungarian artillery division. Both units were inspected by Jemal Pasha in end of May 1916. An airfield was build in Be’er sheva which was already attacked by British planes in June 1916. On Juli 4, the Austrian/German and Ottoman troops left Be’er Sheva for El Arish as collecting point for the second advance against the Suez canal. The attack started on August 3 with approx. 16.000 men and lasted until August 14 (Battle of Romani).

The Allied forces with superior material and supply gained more and more ground (conquering Sinai). Due to the Allied pressure, El Arish was abandoned in Mid December 1916 and the German planes were removed from Be’er Sheva to Ramle in January 1917. The Allied started to attack Gaza in February 1917. In order to stabilize the front, Kressenstein draw its remaining troops from the Sinai back to Be’er Sheva in March 1917. Be’er Sheva was considered the gate to Jerusalem. By September 1917, more and more troops were stationed in Be’er Sheva such as the 3rd Ottoman Cavalry Division and the 27th Infantry Division under Colonel Ibrahim Bey enforced by the 1st Regt. of the 16th Division with 3 batteries and parts of the 24th Division. The defence of Be’er Sheva was coordinated by colonel Ismed Bey.

Due to its strategic position, Be’er Sheva played an important role in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of the Allied Forces. As part of the 3rd Battle for Gaza and the, General Allenby's troops breached the line of Turkish defense between Gaza and Be’er Sheva On October 31, 1917. 800 soldiers of the Australian 4th and 12th Regiments of the 4th Light Horse Brigade with only horses and bayonets, charged the Turkish trenches, overran them and captured the important wells of Be’er Sheva in what has become known as the &amp;quot;last successful cavalry charge in British military history.&amp;quot; 
The Ottomans defended bravely but the Allied forces were superior. The defence included Tel Be’er Sheva on which 1 Infantry battalion of 300 Ottomans with 6 machine guns was stationed. These men occupied 2 British cavalry divsions for six hours allowing time for the retreat to Tel Sheria and saving scarce equipment. In total, the Allied lost for the conquest of Be’er Shevea 136 men with more than 1.000 injured. On Ottoman side, 281 Turkish soldiers died.

On the edge of Be’er Sheva's Old City is a Commonwealth cemetery. The Turkish government errected nearby the train station a memorial stone for the fallen Ottoman soldiers. In the Sinai there exists no Ottoman war cemetary. The fallen Germans were brought in the 1930’s to the central German war cemetary in Nazareth if it was possible to locate and identify their graves. A statue of Allenby was errected within the remains of the old Ottoman central square.

Be’er Sheva was a major administrative center during the period of the British Mandate for Palestine. A railway was constructed between Rafah and Be’er Sheva in October 1917; it opened to the public in May 1918, serving the Negev and settlements south of Mount Hebron. In 1928, at the beginning of the tension between the Jews and the Arabs over Palestine, wide-scale riots broke out which left 133 Jews dead and 339 wounded, many Jews abandoned Be’er Sheva. After an Arab attack on a Jewish bus in 1936, which escalated into the 1936-1939 Arab revolt in Palestine, the remaining Jews left.

The 1947 UN Partition Plan included Beersheba in the territory alotted to the proposed Arab state as the city's population of 4,000 was primarily Arab. The Egyptian army was stationed in Be’er Sheva in May 1948.

During the Israeli Independence War, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion gave the green light for the city to be conquered. Israeli Air Force bombing raids began during the night of October 18/19, 1948. The Arab residents fled en masse the next day on foot and in buses. More bombing raids followed that night, and on October 21 the 8th Brigade's 89th battalion and the Negev Brigade’s 7th and 9th battalions moved in. The Egyptian forces were surrounded and Be’er Sheva was soon in Israeli hands. Around 120 Egyptian soldiers were taken prisoner, and the remaining civilians, 200 men and 150 women and children, were taken to the police fort. On October 25, the women, children, disabled, and elderly were driven by truck to the Gaza border. 

Today, Be’er Sheva is a rather peaceful place with many Russian immigrants. Occasionally, Palestinian Hamas send rockets and cause destruction such as in mid of March 2011.

Railway sideline dam on the left (camera position) and main dam on the right just below the hill Tel Sheria, part of the former Ottoman railway line (from Afula to the Sinai).  

Here is a bit of the history of the place:
After the unsuccessful advances against the Suez Canal and realizing the superiority of Allied troops being cumulated in Egypt, the German-Austrian-Ottoman troops drew back until the line Gaza - Tel Sheria - Be’er Sheva.

In the following battles for Gaza, German general Kress von Kressenstein moved his HQ from Be’er Sheva to Tel Sheria on March 23rd 1917 in order to better coordinate the troops. All Germans lived alike the Ottomans in tents. The HQ was later transferred to Huj (April) and Huleikat (September). After the second failed advance by Allied troops to take Gaza (April 1917), General Allenby took over the command. He and his troops captured Be’er Sheva on October 31st, 1917. The Axis troops retreated to the line Tel Sheria - Abu Chuff - Daharije but still held Gaza. In the first week of November 1917 Allenby started the third attack against Gaza. Outnumbering the Axis troops (80,000 rifles against 20,000 on Ottoman side, 15,000 sabres against approx. 1,300 sabres of the Ottomans and 400 cannons against about 190 on the side of the Ottomans), Allenby dominated the battle. He further build up pressure against the defence line. Being without reserves, Kressenstein demanded the retreat of Gaza in order to hold the line which he received.

On October 6th, Allied troops started attacks against the Tel Sheria and the defence line. Tell Sheria was courageously defended by Ottoman general Ali Fuad Bey. As the Allied were focusing on those attacks, the Ottomans withdrew their troops unnoticed by the Allied from Gaza. On October 7th, Allied troops broke the defence line and conquered Tel Sheria, the same day they occupied Gaza.

Later, the Palestine Railway had laid a new route from Central Israel to Be'ersheva and with the change, the southern section of the railway including the station of Tel Sheria became dispensable.</description>

In Tel Sheria he was awarded the Gallipoli Star (Iron Half Cresent/Eiserner Halbmond) and the document was issued by Kress von Kressenstein.</description>

      <description>The old train station (part of the line from Afula to the Sinai) was located on the other side of the Wadi. Some debris can be seen but I am not sure if they originate in the station building or the railway bridge. 
The railway station was sold by Palestine Railways and dismantled.

Here is a bit of the history of the place:
After the unsuccessful advances against the Suez Canal and realizing the superiority of Allied troops being cumulated in Egypt, the German-Austrian-Ottoman troops drew back until the line Gaza - Tel Sheria - Be’er Sheva.

In the following battles for Gaza, German general Kress von Kressenstein moved his HQ from Be’er Sheva to Tel Sheria on March 23rd 1917 in order to better coordinate the troops. All Germans lived alike the Ottomans in tents. The HQ was later transferred to Huj (April) and Huleikat (September). After the second failed advance by Allied troops to take Gaza (April 1917), General Allenby took over the command. He and his troops captured Be’er Sheva on October 31st, 1917. The Axis troops retreated to the line Tel Sheria - Abu Chuff - Daharije but still held Gaza. In the first week of November 1917 Allenby started the third attack against Gaza. Outnumbering the Axis troops (80,000 rifles against 20,000 on Ottoman side, 15,000 sabres against approx. 1,300 sabres of the Ottomans and 400 cannons against about 190 on the side of the Ottomans), Allenby dominated the battle. He further build up pressure against the defence line. Being without reserves, Kressenstein demanded the retreat of Gaza in order to hold the line which he received.

On October 6th, Allied troops started attacks against the Tel Sheria and the defence line. Tell Sheria was courageously defended by Ottoman general Ali Fuad Bey. As the Allied were focusing on those attacks, the Ottomans withdrew their troops unnoticed by the Allied from Gaza. On October 7th, Allied troops broke the defence line and conquered Tel Sheria, the same day they occupied Gaza.

Later, the Palestine Railway had laid a new route from Central Israel to Be'ersheva and with the change, the southern section of the railway including the station of Tel Sheria became dispensable. The station was sold and dismantled.</description>

Of the two railway bridges, only ruins remain but the dams of the main and sideline are still in relatively good conditions. The railway station was sold by Palestine Railways and dismantled.

The dirtroad/paths are used today for quad-tours within the farm.

This railway bridge was errected as part of the Afula-Sinai line. Works started in January 1915 in Sileh (Silat ad-Dahr) and reached Be'er Sheva (a distance of almost 180 km) already in October 1915. It was build by 2000 trained Ottoman soldiers under the direction of German Meissner Pasha.</description>

      <description>The mosque was built by the caliph Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik in 715-717, but was completed by his successor Umar II by 720. The mosque itself was constructed of marble, while its courtyard was made of other local stone.

An earthquake in January 1034 destroyed the mosque, &amp;quot;leaving it in a heap of ruins&amp;quot;, along with a third of the city. In 1047, Nasir Khusraw reported that the mosque had been rebuilt.

After the initial construction Ilyas Ibn Abd Allah supervised the second phase design of the western enclosure wall and the central ablutions building for ?ala? ad-Din (Saladin) in 1190 CE. The third phase, in 1267-1268, began after the Crusader occupation was terminated. On the orders of the Mamluk sultan al-Zahir Baybars rededicated as a mosque and was modified by incorporating the dome, placing a new pulpit and prayer niche and adding the minaret.

      <description>The mosque was built by the caliph Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik in 715-717, but was completed by his successor Umar II by 720. The mosque itself was constructed of marble, while its courtyard was made of other local stone.

An earthquake in January 1034 destroyed the mosque, &amp;quot;leaving it in a heap of ruins&amp;quot;, along with a third of the city. In 1047, Nasir Khusraw reported that the mosque had been rebuilt.

After the initial construction Ilyas Ibn Abd Allah supervised the second phase design of the western enclosure wall and the central ablutions building for ?ala? ad-Din (Saladin) in 1190 CE. The third phase, in 1267-1268, began after the Crusader occupation was terminated. On the orders of the Mamluk sultan al-Zahir Baybars rededicated as a mosque and was modified by incorporating the dome, placing a new pulpit and prayer niche and adding the minaret.

      <description>Security guard experience
 
Israel and its people are living under a constant threat. As result, they have built up a highly effective and professional security system, perhaps the best in the world. I had been three times in IL, seeing most of the country (several thousand kilometres in that relatively small country), often off the beaten track including visits in the Westbank searching for traits of the old railway. As matter of fact, I profited from this system. During my trips, I had to pass many check-points. Let's say 99% of the guards, were doing a really good job, highly professional, sometimes friendly but at least fair. 
The next experience is about the 0.0X% were the performance was below the usual high average. 

I respect in general all guards or security staff that I had met. These, and all around the world are men and women who risk their health and perhaps life for the security of others. However, in the following story/experience, I see potential for improvement! If it was due to lack of training or just because of a bad day, if security staff has a certain amount of power while you have none (having done nothing), and you are held and exposed to more than it usually takes, one can feel easily harrassed. With respect to tourists, there is no need for that. Maybe, one of the responsible officers gets this in his fingers to think about ways to improve.

As I was a tourist, and I consciously dressed as such to be recognised immediately, I focus solely on the relation security staff towards tourists.
Tourism is a significant source of income for many IL-citizens and in general, Israelis are very kind, helpful and hospitable to tourists, they treat them as guests which is a very good experience. Tourism is also a chance to show how life really is in IL and the more people come, the more chances are to reduce stereotypes.

This picture has cost me about 45 minutes in the hands of the local railway security guards…what did I do?
 
I took for my documentation this photograph of the old station building. Right afterwards an armed security man showed up asking me what I was doing. Up to here, he was right to ask and merely doing his job. However, when he checked my passport and he noted I had been travelling in Arab countries such as Syria and Lebanon earlier, his eyes got big and he got suspicious. It is not actually fun to have your passport being taken and you are in the hands of someone who suspects you of terrorism simply because you had been to neighbouring countries Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. However, we get screened when entering IL and if people like me would pose a threat, we would not have been allowed to enter IL. Certainly, I was not hiding anything.

I haven’t met anyone not being positively impressed by Syria and its people who had travelled in the country. Syrians had left a great and positive impression on me due to their amazing hospitality and great culture and Beirut is truly an awesome bustling city with a nightlife not less than in Tel Aviv or London. What did the security guy think? All Syrians are terrorists? He does not has the chance even if he would be interested. Israelis are not allowed into Syria due to the political situation and tourists with an Israeli stamp are neither granted entry into Syria. Going to these countries has no correlation of being Anti-Israeli. Unfortunately, some Israelis as this security guy seem to see a correlation due to their negative associations. Without doubt, there are people who are anti-Israeli in Lebanon and Syria such as those Palestinian refugees who had lost the land of their ancestors. Then again, in three trips in the region I only met ONE person who spoke bad about Israel, he was a Palestinian taxi driver in Damascus. Apart from that, Israel was no issue at all to normal people whom I had met. The current situation in Syria shows clearly that the people have other priorities. 
 
Last year when I came the first time to Israel, I had no negative experience with security at all. Even though I am German (I had expected negative stereotypes because of that), I was always welcome and Israelis had been very friendly and helpful. 
Unfortunately, this year it was different. I had already made negative experience about being suspected being anti-Israeli due to my Arab stamps in the first moments when I had entered Israel at the airport Tel Aviv. At the passport control I was taken aside and had to go for two interviews as a sort of ‘special welcome’ to those who had been in Arab countries. Everyone who had been there is automatically under terror-suspicion according to the view of either black or white. How can a loyal friend of Israel go to ‘these people’? 
I am not an enemy of Israel nor of Syria. Both countries are interesting and in both countries normal people have been really nice to me. I enjoyed travelling in both Israel and Syria and consider myself open minded. This open minded view is somehow missing apparently with some security staff in Israel. 

Anyhow, I had arrived in April 2011 at 4 am and had to do the interviews at the border which had costs me one hour. The security guy at the airport doing the two interviews was a young, unfriendly and very arrogant man. Maybe he just had a bad day and let off his steam with me? I was cooperative and all information was at hand during the first interview, there was no need for a second one.
Afterwards, I had to search for my luggage (the line was closed meanwhile). When finding my luggage, it had been turned upside down, it was searched completely, all a mess. Eventually, at 6 am I was ready to leave the airport and not willing to enjoy more hospitality of this kind.
 
But back to the Lod train station situation. The guy who stopped me was armed with a gun placed on a shoulder extension and he has probably seen himself as the big hero catching a bad boy. Soon after, two more railway security showed up, both armed. The first security guy explained them in Hebrew his ‘big catch’ and pointed on my Syria visa using the word Iraq…:-))))  
Of course I was kind enough to inform the poor guy that the visa was from Syria and not Iraq (the word Syria is stated on the visa…those who are able to read have a clear advantage).
They were then checking my photobag and again my passport and asking me questions about what I was doing, why I was taking photographs of the station and such things which are unpleasant but okay due to the actual threat of terrorism in the country. Up to here I did not mind and rather considering it funny how the first security guard tried to make himself important in front of his mates. 
 
About 10 minutes later, the police arrived. Now there were five men around me. Again, I was asked the same questions and then the police started searching my photobag, my photos (on camera screen) and my rental car. It seems, the security is not allowed to search in detail. Again, due to the constant threat of terror attacks, this measure is acceptable and I fully cooperated although the five men were not really providing me with the feeling of being welcome as a guest in Israel. 
 
After about half an hour, it was more than obvious that I was just a harmless tourist with interest in railway. Not more and not less. As I did not break any law and as the police recognised quickly that I was no thread, the police moved away.
Up to here, I can would not lose a single word about the entire procedure. With the police leaving, all was settled...so my thought. 

However, from then on, the three guys were wasting my time. They kept holding me and my passport although they had obviously no real plan what to do with me.
This was harassing a tourist! Here, the incompetence of these three men was shown impressively and in my mind I was already comparing them with the famous three monkeys. As a suspect and foreigner, what to do? There are no option except writing it down. I hope for other tourist that the Israeli railway will improve its training for security personnel. In comparison to the professional work of the IL soldiers, these three guys were not a good advertisement for their profession (similar to the one guy at Tel Aviv airport) and country. After another 10 minutes of wasting time, three more railway security people arrived at the scene. Fortunately, they were absolutely relaxed and not at all interested in me. They turned out to be the evening shift. With their arrival I was allowed to go. 
You can be sure I asked one of the three ‘experts’ whether I was allowed to take a closer shot of the old building (this is not prohibited in Israel) as compensation for spending so much time (thinking: wasting my time)…can you image his answer? Correct, it was a clear ‘no’   :-))

The old railway station was probably build by the French and was later located on the line from Afula to the Sinai.</description>

      <description>The Crusaders built a fortress on the site of Majdal Yaba now called Mirabel in 1150 AD.
 
In 1192 AD, Mirabel was conquered by Saladin/Salah ad-Din.
Later, after his defeat at the battle of Arsuf, he gave orders to dismantle the walls of &amp;quot;Mirabel&amp;quot;, Majdal Yaba was abandoned.
 
In 1573 AD, the Ottoman began with the construction of the 8,000 m2 fort of Biñar-baši (fountain-head, Ras el-Ain in Arabic), complete with barracks and a small mosque, which dominates the summit of the Tel today. 
 
During the First World War, Ras el-Ain was an Ottoman stronghold against the British, who bombarded the fortress. German general Kress von Kressenstein had his headquarter in Ras El-Ain for a while during 1918, however, I don't know if it was Mirabel or Antipatris.
 
On Sept 12. 1918, the 162nd and 163rd Brigades advanced and captured Mezeirah (l/5th Bedfords and 1/1 1th Londons) Kh. Dikerin (l/4th Northamptons), Mejdel Yaba (1/lOth Londons), and Ras el Ain (l/4th Norfolks). 

Rosh HaAyin was founded in the 1950s near the site of ancient Antipatris, on the grounds of a British military camp.
Many of the residents were Yemenite Jews airlifted to Israel in 1949 and 1950 in Operation Magic Carpet.</description>

The old Ras el Ain railway station was standing during the British Mandate period. However, the building was blown up completely in 1947 by Jewish underground-fighters and was replaced by a new standard Palestine Railways building afterwards.</description>

      <description>The former Ottoman railway station building is now occupied by the Israeli police in form of a police station. For obvious reason, I was not allowed to take a picture of the old station building. This building is located just outside the police station area and dates back from the times of the British mandate.

The border to Qalqilya is close by. Usually, there are shops which offer drinks. When I went there, I met a local Arab who spoke English. He told me, parts of the railway are remaining within Qalqilya on the Westbank side. Although this sounded rather strange, I gave it a try and went to the border asking to get into Qalqilya. The usual security check began, taking my passport and counter-check with Tel-Aviv about my background. I am not politically involved and had no bad intentions whatsoever.

After 45 minutes, the guard returned with my passport telling me I cannot cross into Qalqilya here. No reasons were given. The long waiting time is standard unless crossing into the Westbank from Jerusalem. However, this was the only case that I was refused entry.

I found another (legal) way.</description>

      <description>Today, the Ottoman train station is isolated by a security wall from Palestine city of Tulkarem, located within an Israeli industrial estate. The industrial area is again split into different grounds, let to different Israeli companies. The railway station is hence scattered on the ground of approx. four different companies. Two of these companies were friendly and granted me access on their grounds. 

Concerning the ownership, one helpful manager explained that the land on which his company is build on belongs to the Palestinians (city of Tulkarem). However, the industrial ground is under Israeli authority (state land guarded by the IL Army). The companies have let the ground from an Israeli administration (I did not ask for details). 

As you can see on the photographs, the wall of the industrial area became part of the security wall. The wall securing the industrial compound has a steel gate. Most of the workers come from Tulkarem. To let the Palestinian workers enter the area, a special gate in the wall of the industrial estate opens once in the morning and in the evening to let them go home. The only good thing about it is that the companies are providing work to the Palestinians, even though the wages is very low. The city of Tulkarem, isolated by the Israeli security wall, hasn’t much work to offer and people suffer from very high unemployment. Somehow, despite the negative circumstances and the low salaries, this is a good development as both parties can only live in peace and prosperity if they cooperate and tolerate each other. 

As you can see, the conditions of the station buildings are terrible. They are not intentionally damaged but simply neglected over decades, long before the industrial ground was established and nothing has improved since then. Speaking with one of the managers, he explained that he had no choice than to accept those buildings on the ground which he was able to let. They form an obstacle to his production and working processes. 
While historical Ottoman railway stations in Israel are often in a bad condition, they are at least protected with a status simliar to national herritage (a blue sign). However, the Ottoman railway buildings here are theoretically on Palestinian ground (practically occupied by Israel) and therefore not protected by the Israelis as far as I can see. At least, I wasn’t able to see the blue sign signaling special status.
Why does Israel occupy the old train station to build an industrial area on its ground? They could have move a few hundred meters further north or south for not involving those buildings?!


History of the train station:
In early 1915, the Ottoman-German troops under General Kress von Kressenstein and Jemal Pasha attacked the Suez canal the first time. One of the reasons for the failure of the operation was insufficient supply. By that time, the railway connection with the main supply line (Hejaz railway) was only operating until Sileh (Silat ad-Dhar) via Afula.
For a second advance in 1916, the railway had to be extended to Beer Sheva (reaching Beer Sheva already in October 1915) under the direction of the German railway engineer Heinrich August Meißner.
For this purpose, the Ottomans turned Tulkarem into a major rail junction. Works started in January 1915 in Sileh (Silat ad Dhar). In February or March 1915 railway access was possible from Afula to Tulkarem. The water tower was errected in autumn 1915.
The German EBSK 11 (Railway Construction Special Commando) under Captain (Hauptmann) Borck was responsible for the entire operations between Samach and Tulkarem until from 1914-1917.

The Ottoman Army used Tulkarem as headquarter for its 8th army (Jevad Pasha) in summer 1918. During the socalled Battle of Megiddo, Tulkarem was captured on 18th September 1918 by Allenby’s forces, capturing 7.000 Ottoman soldiers.</description>

      <description>The Great Lavra of St. Sabbas the Sanctified, is a Greek Orthodox monastery overlooking the Kidron Valley in the West Bank east of Bethlehem. The traditional date for the founding of the monastery by Saint Sabas of Cappadocia is the year 483 and today houses around 20 monks. It is considered to be one of the oldest inhabited monasteries in the world, and still maintains many of its ancient traditions. 

The monastery holds the relics of St. Sabbas the Sanctified. Mar Saba was also the home of St. John of Damascus (676 - 749).

      <description>The Great Lavra of St. Sabbas the Sanctified, is a Greek Orthodox monastery overlooking the Kidron Valley in the West Bank east of Bethlehem. The traditional date for the founding of the monastery by Saint Sabas of Cappadocia is the year 483 and today houses around 20 monks. It is considered to be one of the oldest inhabited monasteries in the world, and still maintains many of its ancient traditions. 

The monastery holds the relics of St. Sabbas the Sanctified. Mar Saba was also the home of St. John of Damascus (676 - 749).

      <description>Last year, I had hired a taxi to Jericho and then wanted to go from Jericho to Mar Es Saba monastery. Right at this Israeli checkpoint, within the Westbank, the armed Israeli officer denied us access to the road leading to the monastery (some 10 kilometers away). No reasons were given. When I asked politely, he gave us a bad look and said something unfriendly in Hebrew to the Palestinian taxi driver who was somehow intimidated and advised me to shut up (even though I was not arguing but just interested about the problem) and we went straight forward to Bethlehem. 

On one hand side, I felt angry about the arrogant guy who had the power to do whatever he wanted including to be unfriendly without reason.
Considering with more time, doing military service in the Westbank is not fun at all for the Israelis. They are basically in enemy land and always have to fear attacks. If staying there too long under constant pressure, it is not good for 'manners' to say it politely. Well, it is not a real excuse and most of the 'normal' Palestinians complain about the arrogance and bad treatment by the IL army within the Westbank.

In contrast to this place, the behaviour of the soldiers within Israel towards me was professional and impeccable. Actually almost all Israelis including security personnel in Israel are very helpful and friendly.

This year, I tried it again and we were able to go thru without any questioning or problems...just as it should be ;-)</description>

The advance of General Allenby followed the sources of water. Even though they would have had the possibility to advance against the Ottomans right thru the desert, the Allied were depending on great amount of water to feed not only its men but its horses and camels. The same applies to the Ottomans/Germans/Austrians on the other side. If the pools would have been destroyed, the entire advance would have been delayed. Its undistroyed capture was hence of great importance for the Allied forces in WW1.</description>

      <description>Today, water plays still a very important role. According to my Palestinian taxi driver, Israel is controlling the water supplies of Bethlehem. It might be true but then, why don't the locals do something about it and care more about their pools and water storages?</description>

      <description>Palestinian tv right in front of the security wall. I have no idea what it was about but I expect it to be about either Israeli politics or the wall itself.

I was on the way back from Nablus/Ramallah to Jerusalem. Even though this border station is very efficient organised (in comparison to Jenin and Qalquliya), it takes almost half an hour to pass the security and control area. To many Palesitians who pass daily to their work in West-Jerusalem, this is a real frustrating experience which repeats again and again. Along the waiting area many electronic installations have been broken and tempers of people go up very easily against the Israeli staff behind security glass. Then again, it is certainly no fun to serve here as Israeli. Noone is happy about it.</description>

      <description>Archeologists have found Samaritan altar remains dating back to the 5th or 6th century BC. The temple had been destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar, probably in the middle of 5th century BCE.
What can be seen today on top of Mt. Gerizim is a church built in 475 AD and its fortification. In 529 AD, Justinian I made Samaritanism illegal, and arranged for a protective wall to be constructed around the church. As a result, the same year, Julianus ben Sabar lead a pro-Samaritan revolt, and by 530 AD had captured most of Samaria, destroying churches and killing the priests and officials. However in 531 AD, after Justinian enlisted the help of Ghassanids, the revolt was completely quashed, and surviving Samaritans were mostly enslaved or exiled. In 533 AD Justinian had a castle constructed on Mount Gerizim to protect the church from raids by the few disgruntled Samaritans left in the area.

The mountain is sacred to the Samaritans who regard it, rather than Jerusalem's Temple Mount, as having been the location chosen by Yahweh for a holy temple. The mountain continues to be the centre of Samaritan religion to this day, and over 90% of the worldwide population of Samaritans live in very close proximity to Gerizim, mostly in Kiryat Luza, the main village.</description>

      <description>When I was going to Nablus last year, it was a rather difficult task. I had to go with a small bus from Jerusalem to Ramallah and here getting a normal public bus to Nablus. This wasn't difficult. The difficulty last year were the Israeli road blocks within the Westbank. The bus needed almost 3 hours to circumvent some road blocks. All but the last road block right at the southern part of Nablus, the entry to Nablus. Here we had to stop and were checked. The control was ice-cold, tension on both sides, but professional. A lot of IL soldiers, bunkers, arms, fences with watchtowers could be spotted, rather an intimitading view (which was obviously the purpose). Nablus as one of the biggest cities in the Westbank was a center for the Intifada. By last year, the situation was relatively relaxed. People were allowed to move while some 5 years earlier, Nablus was more or less a prison-city, isolated by the Israelis.
Fortunately, not only for me but also for the people of Nablus (and also for the Israelis...they also need security), this year things developed a lot to the better. This time, the bus from Ramallah needed something like 1,5 hours only. I had planned a lot more. When our public bus reached the the last road block, it was reduced in terms of appearance, less martial and with much fewer IL soldiers. We were allowed thru without much of a huzzle.
Hopefully, this development can be continued.</description>

      <description>Considering the age of the building, that it is out of service and the destruction during the last Intifadas, the station is in a relatively good condition. Note the broken roof....

The old station is a side-line of the Afula - Beer Sheva line, starting in Messoudije to Nablus and back. The extension of the railway to Nablus was built in 1911–12. The construction work for the station building was started relatively late in end of 1917 and were unfinished when the Allied troops conquered Nablus. What makes the station somehow unique is that its architecture was different to standard Ottoman Hedjaz-/Palestinerailway-style.

The British finished the station and a train run once a week from Haifa to Nablus via Afula. The railway was destroyed during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War and never rebuilt.</description>

      <description>The interior of the old building is today used on the left by a little supermarket/shop. Here are the two owners who requested me to take a photograph. Almost everywhere in the Westbank, local Palestinians are very hospitable and cordial to the few tourists who make it into this region. Needless to say that they gave me some fruits for free for my way to Sileh and Tulkarem...I regreted not having brought something useful or decorative...they certainly did not accept money.

      <description>When I was last year in Nablus, noone of the local Palestinians was able to show me where the old station was. Most said, the station was broken down. Some admitted not to know that Nablus had a train station. When I returned this year to Nablus, I knew where to look for it and to see in detail what is left of the old place.

It rather shows the importance of the destroyed line and the priorities locals here have...trying to make a stable life instead of considering local history.

Luckily, when driving out of Nablus in a public bus (to Ramallah), I was able to see the station but unable to get out again.

      <description>The Church of All Nations, also known as the Church or Basilica of the Agony, is a Roman Catholic church located on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem, next to the Garden of Gethsemane. 

The current church rests on the foundations of two earlier ones, that of a small 12th century Crusader chapel abandoned in 1345, and a 4th century Byzantine basilica, destroyed by an earthquake in 746. In 1920, during work on the foundations, a column was found two meters beneath the floor of the medieval crusader chapel. Fragments of a magnificent mosaic were also found. Following this discovery the architect immediately removed the new foundations and began excavations of the earlier church. After the remains of the Byzantine era church were fully excavated plans for the new church were altered and work continued on the current basilica from April 19, 1922 until June, 1924 when it was consecrated.

      <description>The Church of All Nations, also known as the Church or Basilica of the Agony, is a Roman Catholic church located on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem, next to the Garden of Gethsemane. 

The current church rests on the foundations of two earlier ones, that of a small 12th century Crusader chapel abandoned in 1345, and a 4th century Byzantine basilica, destroyed by an earthquake in 746. In 1920, during work on the foundations, a column was found two meters beneath the floor of the medieval crusader chapel. Fragments of a magnificent mosaic were also found. Following this discovery the architect immediately removed the new foundations and began excavations of the earlier church. After the remains of the Byzantine era church were fully excavated plans for the new church were altered and work continued on the current basilica from April 19, 1922 until June, 1924 when it was consecrated.

      <description>Two weeks before I had left to Jerusalem, a bomb exploded in or at a public bus. However, security measures are always high and I felt no fear. 

As you can see, the soldiers are as well very relaxed...good sign! 
Actually, they are securing a house within the Old City in which some Jewish settlers live, kind of provocation right among all the Palestinian Arabs. I guess these Israelis living in that neighbourhood don't pay the bill for the security guarding them ;-)</description>

      <description>Most of the buildings in what is today the Jewish quarter were destroyed in the war 1948 and further damage later on during the Six-day-war (June 1967). What can be seen today is mostly rebuild afterwards.

      <description>When travelling in Israel, I had the chance to meet some very friendly people. Despite some of their complaints about the differences within their society, I was in contrast very impressed about the level of integration the Israeli society has achieved. 
The Jews who immigrated from other countries to Israel, e.g. from Jemen, Ethopia, Russia and even India, brought with them not only good ideas but also the customs, languages and mentalities of those countries. Further, there are significant differences of live-styles, e.g. Orthodox Jews and even within the Orthodox.

This group picture represents quite well the visual difference within the society and at the same time, that all these people identify themselves with the same main targets and have achieved to work efficiently together as a group.

Comparing the level of integration of foreigners into almost any European society, we still have a long way to go.</description>

      <description>Since at least the fourth century CE a structure identified as the Cenacle, the site of the Last Supper, has been a popular Christian pilgrimage site on Mount Sion in Jerusalem. It is documented in the narratives of many early pilgrims such as Egeria, who visited in 384.[12] The building has experienced numerous cycles of destruction and reconstruction, culminating in the Gothic structure which stands today.

the Cenacle is considered the site where many other events described in the New Testament took place,[3][4] such as:

the Washing of the Feet[5] 
some resurrection appearances of Jesus[6][7][8] 
the gathering of the disciples after the Ascension of Jesus[9] 
the election of Saint Matthias as apostle[10] 
the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the disciples on the day of Pentecost[11] 

While the church was destroyed sometime after 1219, the Cenacle was spared.[16] In the 1340s, it passed into the custody of the Franciscan Order of Friars, who maintained the structure until 1552, when the Ottoman Empire took possession of it. After the Franciscan friars' eviction, this room was transformed into a mosque, as evidenced by the mihrab in the direction of Mecca and an Arabic inscription prohibiting public prayer at the site. Christians were not allowed to return until the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948.

      <description>The Lutheran Church of the Redeemer is the second Protestant church in the Old City of Jerusalem (the first being Christ Church near Jaffa Gate). It is a property of the Evangelical Jerusalem Foundation, one of the three foundations of the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD) in the Holy Land. Built between 1893 and 1898 by the architect Paul Ferdinand Groth (*1859-1955*) following the designs of Friedrich Adler, the Church of the Redeemer currently houses Lutheran congregations that worship in Arabic, German, Danish, and English. The Church, together with the adjoining provost building, is the seat of the Provost of the German Protestant Ministries in the Holy Land (&amp;quot;Evangelisch in Jerusalem&amp;quot;). It also serves as the headquarters of the Bishop of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Jordan and the Holy Land, since this Arabic-speaking (Palestinian) church became independent from the German provost in 1979.

Built on land given to King William I of Prussia (after 1870 Kaiser Wilhelm I) in 1869 by Sultan Abdülaziz of the Ottoman Empire, the church was constructed from 1892-1898. The location had been the site of the old church of St. Mary Minor. In 1898, Kaiser Wilhelm II made a trip to Jerusalem to personally dedicate the new church.

      <description>The Stone of Anointing, also known as The Stone of Unction, which tradition claims to be the spot where Jesus' body was prepared for burial by Joseph of Arimathea. However, this tradition is only attested since the crusader era, and the present stone was only added in the 1810 reconstruction.[22] The wall behind the stone was a temporary addition to support the arch above it, which had been weakened after the damage in the 1808 fire; the wall blocks the view of the rotunda, sits on top of the graves of four 12th century kings, and is no longer structurally necessary. There is a difference of opinion as to whether it is the 13th Station of the Cross, which others identify as the lowering of Jesus from the cross and locate between the 11th and 12th station up on Calvary. The lamps that hang over the stone are contributed by Armenians, Copts, Greeks and Latins.

Today it also serves as the headquarters of the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem, while control of the building is shared between several Christian churches and secular entities in complicated arrangements essentially unchanged for centuries. Today, the church is home to Eastern Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism. Anglican and Protestant Christians have no permanent presence in the church.

      <description>The Church of All Nations, also known as the Church or Basilica of the Agony, is a Roman Catholic church located on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem, next to the Garden of Gethsemane. 

The current church rests on the foundations of two earlier ones, that of a small 12th century Crusader chapel abandoned in 1345, and a 4th century Byzantine basilica, destroyed by an earthquake in 746. In 1920, during work on the foundations, a column was found two meters beneath the floor of the medieval crusader chapel. Fragments of a magnificent mosaic were also found. Following this discovery the architect immediately removed the new foundations and began excavations of the earlier church. After the remains of the Byzantine era church were fully excavated plans for the new church were altered and work continued on the current basilica from April 19, 1922 until June, 1924 when it was consecrated.

      <description>The colony was created in the early 1870s by the Templers, a religious Protestant sect formed in southern Germany (Württemberg near Stuttgart) in the 19th century.
The population of German settlers consisted in 1875 only 100 persons. By 1925 it consisted of 158 persons.

After 1939, all Germans in Palestine turned into Enemy aliens. Some of the settlers with patriotic feelings went to Germany to join the war. Several were organised in Palestine in Nazi-organisations such as Hitler Youth, but many others were not. The British authorities decided to intern most of the enemy aliens. For this purpose four settlements Sarona, Bethlehem, Waldheim and Wilhelma were converted into internment camps. In summer 1941, 665 German internees, almost all young families with children, were released to Australia, where they could settle again. Many of the remaining Germans were either too old or too sick, to leave for Australia, while a second group did not want to go there. In December 1941 and in the course of 1942 another 400 German internees, mostly wives and children of men, who had followed the calls for recruitment and had left for Germany, were released to Germany on the purpose of Family reunification. By that time, almost all Nazi supporters or partriots among the settlers had left Palestine.

In 1945 the Italian and Hungarian internees were released. But the Britons refused to repatriate the remaining German internees to the British zone in Germany, because the British zone was flooded with millions of war refugees. Also most of the internees did not want to go to Germany, they had their home in Palestine. In 1947 the British authorities and Australia agreed to allow the remaining German internees to emigrate to the fifth continent. The end of the Mandate forced to hurry the resettlement, thus all the internees were first transferred to Cyprus, to a camp of simple tents near Famagusta. 

By May 14, 1948, when Israel became independent, only about 50 Gentile Germans, mostly elderly and sick persons, were living in the new state. They voluntarily left the country or were successively expelled by the government.</description>

      <description>The German Armin T. Wegner already witnessed the genocide of the Armenians in the Ottoman Empire. He served there as German medical officer.
After the war he married the Jewish author Lola Landau.
Already in April 1933 he protested against the treatment of Jews in Germany under Nazi-rule. As consequence, he was taken into prison and several concentration camps (not death-camps). He left Germany afterwards and settled in Italy where he died in 1978.
This name-tag in Yad Vashem honours him as one of the Righteous among the Nations.

The complex, completed in 1910, included the Evangelical Lutheran Church of the Ascension (evangelische Himmelfahrtskirche) with a 65-meter belltower and a hospice for Christian pilgrims.

The complex was named for Augusta Viktoria, wife of German Emperor Wilhelm II, who visited Jerusalem in 1898. The architect was the German Robert Leibnitz.

After the Emperor's visit, he commissioned the construction of a guesthouse for German pilgrims. Many of the building materials were imported from Germany. A 50-meter high church tower was constructed with four bells, the largest of them weighing six tons.  Augusta Victoria was the first building in the country to have electricity (provided by a diesel generator).

During World War I, the Hospital served as German military hospital. From 1915 to 1917 the compound was used as Ottoman headquarters by Cemal Pasha. From June to December 1917 the hospital was used as headquarters for the German high command of the German expeditionary corps (Asienkorps). After the British conquest, the Augusta Victoria compound served as the headquarters of General Allenby’s Egyptian Expeditionary Force and the headquarters of the British Military Administration of Occupied Enemy Territory (South). From 1920 to 1927, Augusta Victoria was the official residence of the British High Commissioner of the Palestine Mandate. In 1927, the buildings were severely damaged in an earthquake.

After 1937, the building was run as a hospital by German Kaiserwerth Deaconesses.

The British used the building during World War II as military hospital.

Since 1950, the Lutheran World Federation is running the hospital.
 
During the Six-Day War of 1967, the campus was under the control of the Jordanian military and was fortified with several bunkers. During the fighting, the building was damaged.

There had been plans in the 80's to tear-down the building but Jerusalem's mayor Teddy Kollek supported its conservation.

Today, Augusta Victoria functions as a 164-bed hospital predominantly treating Palestinians (approx. 75% of the patients come from Gaza and the West Banks).</description>

      <description>Caves and perhaps earlier tombs in the valley. The valley is inhabited for several thousand years.

The Bible calls the Valley &amp;quot;Valley of Jehoshaphat - Emek Yehoshafat&amp;quot;, meaning &amp;quot;The valley where God will judge.&amp;quot; Kidron Valley was not associated with the Valley of Jehoshaphat until the 4th century AD.

      <description>Built to strengthen a strategically weak point in the Old City's defenses, the citadel that stands today was constructed during the 2nd century BCE and subsequently destroyed and rebuilt by, in succession, the Christian, Muslim, Mamluk, and Ottoman conquerors of Jerusalem. It contains important archaeological finds dating back 2,700 years.

      <description>The contrasts could not be bigger. Upstairs Jewish Israeli settlers trying to secure Israeli interests and downstairs Palestinian Arabs interpreting the commitment of the Israelis as offence and fear loss of their land/homes. On top are video-cameras installed for security. Another symbol of the difficult and complicated situation, causing a lot of tension.</description>

      <description>At the end of the 19th century, the German priest Wilhelm Schmidt had the idea of building a guesthouse to accommodate German pilgrims. Supported by the Emperor William II., the German Association of the Holy Land was able to buy the piece of land next to Damascus Gate. The foundation stone was laid in 1904; the building was completed in 1908.

During WW 1, they house was used by German military occasionally for accomodation, e.g. Kress von Kressenstein. 
Between 1917 and 1950, Paulushaus served the British mandate authorities as an administrative centre and was only given back to the German Association of the Holy Land when the British left the country. It was then decided to integrate Schmidt’s Girls College (offering education for girls independently of their religion) into the complex of buildings until the school’s new premises were opened in the 1960s. Since then, Paulushaus has been a guesthouse mainly visited by German pilgrims.

------------------------------
The first basilica on this site was begun by Saint Helena, the mother of the Emperor Constantine I. Under the supervision of Bishop Makarios of Jerusalem, the construction started in 327 and was completed in 333. That structure was burnt down in the Samaritan Revolt of 529.

The current basilica was rebuilt in its present form in 565 by the Emperor Justinian I. When the Persians under Chosroes II invaded in 614, they unexpectedly did not destroy the structure. According to legend, their commander Shahrbaraz was moved by the depiction inside the church of the Three Magi wearing Persian clothing, and commanded that the building be spared. The Crusaders made further repairs and additions to the building during the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem with permission and help given by the Byzantine Emperor, and the first King of Jerusalem was crowned in the church. Over the years, the compound has been expanded, and today it covers approximately 12,000 square meters. The church was one of the direct causes for French involvement in the Crimean War against Russia.

The church is administered jointly by Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox and Armenian Apostolic authorities. All three traditions maintain monastic communities on the site.

As you can see, it is very difficult to get a picture without pilgrims/tourists (here two Russian ladies). There was a queue of about 20 or more meters..not kidding. It felt more like a theme parque event than at a sagred place.</description>

      <description>Although there isn't much to see today, this place has seen an incredible amount of changes, people, cultures and history.

I tried to make a relatively short summary:
Jericho is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, with evidence of settlement dating back to 9000 BCE.

The first permanent settlement was built near the Ein as-Sultan spring, between 10000 and 9000 BCE and consisted of a number of walls, a religious shrine, and a 23-foot (7.0 m) tower with an internal staircase.After a few centuries, it was abandoned for a second settlement, established in 6800 BCE, perhaps by an invading people who absorbed the original inhabitants into their dominant culture. 

This was followed by a succession of settlements from 4500 BCE onward, the largest of these being constructed in 2600 BCE.

Archaeological evidence indicates that in the latter half of the Middle Bronze Age (circa 1700 BCE), the city enjoyed some prosperity, its walls having been strengthened and expanded. The Canaanite city (Jericho City IV) was destroyed ca. between 1617 and 1530.  

In the 8th century BCE, the Assyrians invaded from the north, followed by the Babylonians, and Jericho was depopulated between 586 and 538 BCE, the period of the Jewish exile to Babylon. Cyrus the Great, the Persian king, refounded the city one mile southeast of its historic site at the mound of Tell es-Sultan, and returned the Jewish exiles after conquering Babylon in 539 BCE.

Jericho went from being an administrative center under Persian rule, to serving as the private estate of Alexander the Great between 336 and 323 BCE after his conquest of the region. In the middle of the 2nd century BCE, Jericho was under Hellenistic rule, and the Syrian General Bacchides built a number of forts to strengthen the defenses of the area around Jericho against invasion by the Macabees.

Herod originally leased Jericho from Cleopatra after Mark Antony gave it to her as a gift. After their joint suicide in 30 BCE, Octavian assumed control of the Roman empire and granted Herod free rein over Jericho. 

The Christian Gospels state that Jesus passed through Jericho where he healed some blind beggars and inspired a local chief tax collector named Zacchaeus to repent of his dishonest practices. The road between Jerusalem and Jericho is the setting for the Parable of the Good Samaritan.

After the fall of Jerusalem to Vespasian armies in 70 CE, Jericho declined rapidly, and by 100 CE it was but a small Roman garrison town. Accounts of Jericho by a Christian pilgrim are given in 333. Shortly thereafter, the built-up area of the town was abandoned, and a Byzantine Jericho, Ericha was built a mile (1 1/2 km) to the east, around which the modern town is centered. Christianity took hold in the city during the Byzantine era and the area was heavily populated. A number of monasteries and churches were built, including St. George of Koziba in 340 CE and a domed church dedicated to Saint Eliseus. At least two synagogues were also built in the 6th century CE. The monasteries were abandoned after the Persian invasion of 614.

By 659 that province had come under the control of Mu'awiya, founder of the Umayyads as a dynasty. That year, an earthquake struck Jericho and destroyed nearly all of it.

The tenth caliph of that dynasty, Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik, built a palatial complex known as Khirbet al-Mafjar about one mile north of Tell as-Sultan in 743, and two mosques, a courtyard, mosaics, and other items from it can still be seen in situ today, despite its having been partially destroyed in an earthquake in 747.

The city flourished until 1071 and the invasion of the Seljuk Turks, followed by the upheavals of the Crusades. In 1179, the Crusaders rebuilt the Monastery of St. George of Koziba, at its original site six miles from the center of town. They also built another two churches and a monastery dedicated to John the Baptist, and are credited with introducing sugarcane production to the city. In 1187, the Crusaders were evicted by the Ayyubid forces of Saladin after their victory in the Battle of Hattin, and the town slowly went into decline.

The Ottomans ruled Jericho from 1517–1918. British and Australian troops captured Jericho on 21st February 1918 in a three-day battle.</description>

      <description>During my travelling in the Palestinian Territory all people had been very hospitable and friendly. The only exception was here on the compound. The responsible person for security was very nervous and almost immediately confiscated my camera. My camera was searched (checking the photos) for something he could not explain, hence, I was not able to help him. He was not very professional and neither qualified, except his big muscles, for which he thought I would be a journalist due to my camera (Canon 50D).
It took me quite some patience to explain him slowly (he spoke basically no English) that I was neither political nor a journalist. After approx. 15 minutes, he counter-checked with his superior who then spoke on mobile with me ordering me not to take pictures of any soldiers. I promised and my camera was returned. Eventually, I was allowed to see the tomb of Arafat without any huzzle.</description>

      <description>Memorial stones errected in 1918 in Roda/Stadtroda.

Rudolf Schierholz became a soldier approx. in 1895 in the Saxon army. He later served in the 108th Saxon Infantry Regiment (Sächsischen Infanterie-Regiment) in the rank of a Major.

In March 1914 he went to Constantinople as part of the German Military Mission. He became an instructor in an Ottoman training center for members of the general staff. 

With the outbreak of the war he became responsible for the coast protection of the 3rd Ottoman division. Later, in the rank of an Ottoman Lieutenant Colonel, he was commanding the 9th infantry regiment in the Dardanelles.

After 1916 he was transferred to the Palestine theater. Commanding a regiment in Ma'an (today Jordan), he was responsible for the protection of the Hedjaz railway against Arab/Bedouin insurgents.

On December 8, 1917, he died in Ma'an because of dysentery (Ruhr) and was buried in Ma'an in a stone tomb.

A memorial stone was errected in his hometown of Roda (Stadtroda) in 1918.

After the conquest by the Allied forces and Arab insurgents, his tomb was partly vandalised.

Due to insufficient funds, it took the German government until 1931, after the world crisis, to establish a war cemetary for the fallen Germans in Palestine. Tombs were searched and brought to the central war cemetery in Nazareth. The tomb of Schierholz was still existent, though damaged, while many others could not be found. When his tomb was opened, the workers got petrified as they found a hand grenade between the bones of his legs.

His remains were transferred in 1932 to the central German war cemetery in Nazareth.</description>

      <description>Shomron or Samaria is under Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. The village right next to the historical city is Sebastiye. Today, the population of Sebastiye consists of mostly Arab muslims.

Samaria was established as the capital of the Kingdom of Israel during the reign of Omri circa 884 BC. During the reign of the last king of the northern kingdom, Hoshea (2 Kings 10), the Assyrians invaded in 722/721 BC  when they established complete control over the capital city and the remainder of the northern kingdom.

New inhabitants were brought in (from Kutha and the Syro-Mesopotamian area, 2 Kings 17:24) and they formed a new Samaritan population. Samaria became a Hellenistic town in 332 BCE and thousands of Macedonian soldiers were settled there following a revolt by the Samaritans. In 30 BCE the emperor Augustus awarded the city to Herod the Great who renamed it Sebaste in honor of Augustus (&amp;quot;Sebaste&amp;quot; is the feminine form of Gr. Sebastos = Augustus). 

Samaritanism is a religion closely related to Judaism, though it is not considered part of it, and its adherents are not considered to be Jews. Samaritanism primarily uses a Torah as its holy book, though little of later Jewish theology. Their temple was built at Mount Gerizim in the middle of fifth century BCE and was destroyed by the Macabbean (Hasmonean) John Hyrcanus late in 110 BCE, although their descendants still worship among its ruins.

      <description>Standing on the old railway dam.

The line from Afula to Nablus was a side-line of the Haifa-Dara'a line (Jezreel railway). The main intention of the Ottomans was to connect the Hedjaz-railway with Jerusalem. However, it was never realized and the project got only until Nablus (stations Afula, Jenin, Sileh, Messoudieh to Nablus).

Works started in 1912 by a French company. In 1913, this line reached Jenin and by 1914, Nablus was almost connected.

When the Ottoman Empire sided with Germany, the French had to abandon their project. The new political situation created the need to extend the line down to the Egyptian border. Up to then, goods and troops were only transported by railway until Sileh. After Sileh, goods had to be transported by trucks or camels and troops had to march via Hebron all the way to Beer Sheva or Audja.
 
The station Messoudieh served as connecting point leading the extention via Tulkarem down south towards the Sinai and southeast to Nablus. 

In early 1915, the Ottoman-German troops under General Kress von Kressenstein attacked the Suez canal the first time. One of the reasons for the failure of the operation was insufficient supply. 
For a second advance in 1916, the railway was extended to Beer Sheva (October 1915) and later to Hafir el Audja (Summer 1916) at the border to Egypt.</description>

      <description>The line from Afula to Nablus was a side-line of the Haifa-Dara'a line (Jezreel railway). The main intention of the Ottomans was to connect the Hedjaz-railway with Jerusalem. However, it was never realized and the project got only until Nablus (stations Afula, Jenin, Sileh, Messoudieh to Nablus).

Works started in 1912 by a French company. In 1913, this line reached Jenin and by 1914, Nablus was almost connected.

When the Ottoman Empire sided with Germany, the French had to abandon their project. The new political situation created the need to extend the line down to the Egyptian border. Up to then, goods and troops were only transported by railway until Sileh. After Sileh, goods had to be transported by trucks or camels and troops had to march via Hebron all the way to Beer Sheva or Audja.
 
The station Messoudieh served as connecting point leading the extention via Tulkarem down south towards the Sinai and southeast to Nablus. 

In early 1915, the Ottoman-German troops under General Kress von Kressenstein attacked the Suez canal the first time. One of the reasons for the failure of the operation was insufficient supply. 
For a second advance in 1916, the railway was extended to Beer Sheva (October 1915) and later to Hafir el Audja (Summer 1916) at the border to Egypt.</description>

The gentleman is the internationally known Palestinian artist and sculptor Nihad Dabit with his eldest daughter Samira-Landa....we exchanged a few words but I had no clue who he was until I received via Flickr the information by Uri Zackhem.

Wilhelma-Hamîdije was named in honour of King William II of Württemberg, Emperor Wilhelm II and Sultan Abdul Hamid II, however, only the first half of the name prevailed. Wilhelma was established by German settlers in Palestine in 1902.

After 1939, all Germans in Palestine turned into Enemy aliens. Some of the settlers with patriotic feelings went to Germany to join the war. Several were organised in Palestine in Nazi-organisations such as Hitler Youth, but many others were not. The British authorities decided to intern most of the enemy aliens. For this purpose four settlements Sarona, Bethlehem, Waldheim and Wilhelma were converted into internment camps. In summer 1941, 665 German internees, almost all young families with children, were released to Australia, where they could settle again. Many of the remaining Germans were either too old or too sick, to leave for Australia, while a second group did not want to go there. In December 1941 and in the course of 1942 another 400 German internees, mostly wives and children of men, who had followed the calls for recruitment and had left for Germany, were released to Germany on the purpose of Family reunification. By that time, almost all Nazi supporters or partriots among the settlers had left Palestine.

In 1945 the Italian and Hungarian internees were released. But the Britons refused to repatriate the remaining German internees to the British zone in Germany, because the British zone was flooded with millions of war refugees. Also most of the internees did not want to go to Germany, they had their home in Palestine. In 1947 the British authorities and Australia agreed to allow the remaining German internees to emigrate to the fifth continent. The end of the Mandate forced to hurry the resettlement, thus all the internees were first transferred to Cyprus, to a camp of simple tents near Famagusta. 

By May 14, 1948, when Israel became independent, only about 50 Gentile Germans, mostly elderly and sick persons, were living in the new state. They voluntarily left the country or were successively expelled by the government.

When all German Templers had left (volunteering or not) the settlement, the former Jewish residents of the abandoned moshav of Atarot (which had been destroyed by the Arab Legion) moved into the houses.

What is now Israel's Ben Gurion International Airport was originally named &amp;quot;Wilhelma Airport&amp;quot; when it was built in 1936 near the Templer community.</description>

      <description>Known under its Greek name Armageddon.
Megiddo was a site of great importance in the ancient world, as it guarded the western branch of a narrow pass and an ancient trade route which connected the lands of Egypt and Assyria. Because of its strategic location at the crossroads of several major routes, Megiddo and its environs have witnessed several major battles throughout history. The site was inhabited from approximately 7000 BC to 586 BC (the same time as the destruction of the First Israelite Temple in Jerusalem by the Babylonians, and subsequent fall of Israelite rule and exile). One of its claims to importance is the fact that since this time it has remained uninhabited, thereby preserving the ruins of its time periods pre-dating 586 BC without newer settlements disturbing them.

Megiddo is mentioned in Ancient Egyptian writings because one of Egypt's mighty kings, Thutmose III, waged war upon the city in 1478 BC. The battle is described in detail in the hieroglyphics found on the walls of his temple in Upper Egypt. Named in the Bible Derekh HaYam (Hebrew: ??? ????), or &amp;quot;Way of the Sea,&amp;quot; it became an important military artery of the Roman Empire and was known as the Via Maris.

In 2005, the remains of Megiddo were designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO as part of the Biblical Tels - Megiddo, Hazor, Beer Sheba.

Megiddo was a site of great importance in the ancient world, as it guarded the western branch of a narrow pass and an ancient trade route which connected the lands of Egypt and Assyria. Because of its strategic location at the crossroads of several major routes, Megiddo and its environs have witnessed several major battles throughout history. The site was inhabited from approximately 7000 BC to 586 BC (the same time as the destruction of the First Israelite Temple in Jerusalem by the Babylonians, and subsequent fall of Israelite rule and exile). One of its claims to importance is the fact that since this time it has remained uninhabited, thereby preserving the ruins of its time periods pre-dating 586 BC without newer settlements disturbing them.

Megiddo is mentioned in Ancient Egyptian writings because one of Egypt's mighty kings, Thutmose III, waged war upon the city in 1478 BC. The battle is described in detail in the hieroglyphics found on the walls of his temple in Upper Egypt. Named in the Bible Derekh HaYam (Hebrew: ??? ????), or &amp;quot;Way of the Sea,&amp;quot; it became an important military artery of the Roman Empire and was known as the Via Maris.

In 2005, the remains of Megiddo were designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO as part of the Biblical Tels - Megiddo, Hazor, Beer Sheba.

      <description>The Battle of Hattin (also known as &amp;quot;The Horns of Hattin&amp;quot; because of a nearby extinct volcano of the same name) took place on Saturday, July 4, 1187, between the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem and the forces of the Ayyubid dynasty.

The Muslim armies under Saladin, Salah ad-Din, captured or killed the vast majority of the Crusader forces, removing their capability to wage war. As a direct result of the battle, Islamic forces once again became the eminent military power in the Holy Land, re-conquering Jerusalem and several other Crusader-held cities. These Christian defeats prompted the Third Crusade, which began two years after the Battle of Hattin.

      <description>Crossing into Jenin from Nazareth was quite stressful. As it is only 30 km distance to Nazareth, I had planned some 2 hours for the short visit. 

But.....being in the border station, my passport was checked (standard procedure). While almost all local Arabs passed thru without problems, it took the Israelis almost 50 minutes to check my papers (I am non-political). Eventually, I was allowed thru and passed without problems the screening area.

After two hours in Jenin, I wanted to continue my travels quickly but got stranded at the border into Israel (see photo). In the beginning, 4 local Palestinians and myself had to wait half an hour before we were even allowed to enter the border station. To my surprise, the same procedure occured again to me. All locals went thru without problems. Only I had to wait 50 minutes for checking my passport. 
I understand the intensive check of my passport when I went into Jenin but noone in the station was willing to explain me why it took the forces so long when I wanted to leave Jenin...

Saying this, normally Israeli officials are consequent in their job but friendly and efficient. E.g. passing the gate from Ramallah into Jerusalem takes around 20 minutes only.</description>

      <description>The line from Afula to Nablus was a side-line of the Haifa-Dara'a line (Jezreel railway). The main intention of the Ottomans was to connect the Hedjaz-railway with Jerusalem. However, it was never realized and the project got only until Nablus (stations Afula, Jenin, Sileh, Messoudieh to Nablus)

Works started in 1912 by a French company. In 1913, this line reached Jenin and by 1914, Nablus was almost connected.

When the Ottoman Empire sided with Germany, the French had to abandon their project. The new political situation created the need to extend the line down to the Egyptian border. Up to then, goods and troops were only transported by railway until Sileh. After Sileh, goods had to be transported by trucks or camels and troops had to march via Hebron all the way to Beer Sheva or Audja. 
The station Messoudieh served as connecting point leading the extention via Tulkarem down south towards the Sinai. 
In early 1915, the Ottoman-German troops under General Kress von Kressenstein attacked the Suez canal the first time. One of the reasons for the failure of the operation was insufficient supply. 
For a second advance in 1916, the railway was extended to Beer Sheva (October 1915) and later to Hafir el Audja (Summer 1916) at the border to Egypt.</description>

      <description>The modern church was built right above the ruins of the house of St. Peter. It is not touching the ruins below but it is probably the most ugly building/architecture in the entire Holy Land. 

In 1838, the American explorer, Edward Robinson discovered the ruins of the ancient Capernaum.

In 1866, British Captain Charles William Wilson identified the remains of the synagogue, and in 1894, Franciscan Friar Giuseppe Baldi of Naples, the Custodian of the Holy Land, was able to recover a good part of the ruins from the Bedouins.

The Franciscans raised a fence to protect the ruins from frequent vandalism, and planted palms and eucalyptus trees brought from Australia to create a small oasis for pilgrims. They also built a small harbor. These considerable labors were directed by the Franciscan Virgilio Corbo.

The most important excavations began in 1905 under the direction of the Germans Heinrich Kohl and Carl Watzinger. They were continued by the Franciscans Fathers Vendelin von Benden (1905–1915) and Gaudenzio Orfali (1921–1926). The excavations resulted in the discovery of two public buildings, the synagogue (which was partially restored by Fr Orfali), and an octagonal church. Later, in 1968, excavation of the western portion of the site—the portion owned by the Franciscans—was restarted by Corbo and Stanislao Loffreda, with the financial assistance of the Italian government. During this phase, the major discovery was of a house which is claimed to be St. Peter's house, in a neighborhood of the town from the 1st century AD. These excavations have been ongoing, with some publication on the Internet as recently as 2003.[4]

The excavations revealed that the site was established at the beginning of the Hasmonean Dynasty, roughly in the 2nd century BC, and was abandoned in the 11th century AD.

The eastern half of the site—the portion owned by an Orthodox monastery—has also been surveyed and partially excavated under the direction of Vasilios Tzaferis. This section has uncovered the village from the Byzantine and Arab periods. Features include a pool apparently used for the processing of fish and a hoard of gold coins. (Tzaferis, 1989).

      <description>Also called Capernaum, it used to be a fishing village inhabited from mid 2nd century BC to 11th century AD.

A church near Capernaum is said to be the home of Saint Peter. When Jesus left Nazareth, he settled in Capernaum where he chose his first four disciples, James, John, Peter and Andrew.

The town is cited in the Gospel of Luke where it was reported to have been the home of the apostles Peter, Andrew, James and John, as well as the tax collector Matthew. In Matthew 4:13 the town was reported to have been the home of Jesus. According to Luke 4:31-44, Jesus taught in the synagogue in Capernaum on Sabbath. Jesus then healed a man who had the spirit of an unclean devil and healed a fever in Simon Peter's mother-in-law. According to Luke 7:1-10, it is also the place where a Roman Centurion asked Jesus to heal his servant. A building which may have been a synagogue of that period has been found beneath the remains of a later synagogue.

Capernaum is also mentioned in the Gospel of Mark (2:1), it is the location of the famous healing of the paralytic lowered through the roof to reach Jesus.

Josephus referred to Capernaum as a fertile spring. He stayed the night there after spraining his ankle. During the first Jewish revolt of 66-70 Capernaum was spared as it was never occupied by the Romans.

      <description>It is the traditional site of the miracle of the multiplication of the loaves and fishes (Mark 6:30-46) and the fourth resurrection appearance of Jesus (John 21:1-24) in Christianity. Until 1948, it was the site of an Arab village.

The earliest building at Tabgha was a small chapel built in the 4th century A.D. This was probably the shrine described by the pilgrim Egeria at the end of the 4th century:
In the same place (not far from Capernaum) facing the Sea of Galilee is a well watered land in which lush grasses grow, with numerous trees and palms. Nearby are seven springs which provide abundant water. In this fruitful garden Jesus fed five thousand people with five loaves of bread and two fish.&amp;quot;[2]
The mosaic of the fish and loaves is laid next to a large rock, which has caused some New Testament scholars to speculate that the builders of the original church believed that Jesus stood on this rock when he blessed the fish and loaves just before the feeding of the crowd who had come to hear him.

The large monastery and a church were built in the fifth century. While some date the destruction of the site to the time of the Arab conquest, the church was most likely destroyed in 614 during the Persian invasion, for already in AD 670, Bishop Arculf had reported that only columns from the church remained.

In 1932, after nearly 1300 years of &amp;quot;solitude&amp;quot;, two German archaeologists (Mader and Schneider) uncovered a number of the Byzantine church's walls and mosaics.

In 1981, after further excavations, the church was finally restored by German Benedictines to its Byzantine form, incorporating portions of the original mosaics.

Today, the church and surrounding land are property of the German Association of the Holy Land whose head is the Archbishop of Cologne. The site is further maintained by Benedictine monks from the Hagia Maria Sion Abbey, also known as Dormition Church, which is located on Mount Zion in Jerusalem.

      <description>The fortress was built around 1229 by Al-Aziz Uthman, nephew of Saladin and younger son of Al-Adil I, to pre-empt any attempt on Damascus by the Sixth Crusade. It was named Qala'at al-Subeiba, &amp;quot;Castle of the Large Cliff&amp;quot; in Arabic. It was further expanded to contain the whole ridge by 1230, and Baibars strengthened it and added larger towers after 1260. The castle was given to Baibars's second-on-command, Bilik. The new governor started the broad construction activities. When the construction was finished, Bilik memorialized his work and glorified the name of sultan in a 1275 inscription. After the death of Baibars, his son arranged for Bilik to be murdered, apparently because he feared his power.

At the end of the 13th century, following the Muslim conquest of the port city of Akko (Acre) and the end of Crusader rule in the Holy Land, the fortress lost strategic value and fell into disrepair.

After the Ottoman Turks conquered the land in 1517, they used the fortress as a luxury prison for Ottoman nobles who had been exiled to Palestine. The fortress was abandoned later in the 16th century and only local shepherds and their flocks were temporary guests within its walls.

The fortress was ruined by an earthquake in the 18th century.

      <description>Sultan Al-Atrash was a Syrian war hero. After forced recruitment by the Ottomans, he had to fight in the Balcan wars 1912 and when returning, he had to find out that his father Zuqan (a photo from my collection can be seen in the set: Historical Syria) was hanged in 1911 by the Ottomans for an uprisal of the Druze in the Hauran. Sultan and his men joined the Great Arab Revolt and they were among the first to enter Damascus. Later, in 1925, he lead the revolt against the French who were ruling Syria after 1918.
Sultan Pasha al-Atrash died on March 26, 1982 from a heart attack. His funeral was attended by more than a million people.

      <description>Majdal Shams is a Druze village situated in the southern foothills of Mt. Hermon. It was occupated by Israel in 1967 and is the largest of the four Druze villages in the Golan.

The inhabitants of Majdal Shams hold Syrian citizenship. For this reason they are not drafted into the Israeli army (although a minority serve voluntarily) and many travel to Syria regularly to visit family or receive university degrees in Damascus.

      <description>Quneitra (also Al Qunaytirah, Qunaitira, or Kuneitra; Arabic: ?????????) is the largely destroyed in a high valley in the Golan Heights. Quneitra was founded in the Ottoman era as a way station on the caravan route to Damascus and subsequently became a garrison town of some 20,000 people, strategically located near the ceasefire line with Israel. 

On 10 June 1967, the last day of the Six-Day War, Quneitra came under Israeli control. It was briefly recaptured by Syria during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, but Israel regained control in its subsequent counter-offensive. The city was almost completely destroyed before the Israeli withdrawal in June 1974. It now lies in the demilitarized United Nations Disengagement Observer Force Zone between Syria and Israel, a short distance from the de facto border between the two countries, and is populated by only a handful of families. Syria refused to rebuild the city and actively discourages resettlement in the area. Israel was heavily criticized by the United Nations for the city's destruction, while Israel has also criticized Syria for not rebuilding Quneitra.

      <description>The Mount of Beatitudes refers to the hill in northern Israel where Jesus delivered the Sermon on the Mount. It is located on the northwestern shore of the Sea of Galilee.
A Byzantine church was erected near the current site in the 4th century, and it was used until the 7th century. Remains of a cistern and a monastery are still visible. The current Roman Catholic Franciscan chapel was built in 1938.

German general Erich von Falkenhayn was in charge of the German-Ottoman forces in Palestine for about a year from early 1917 until January 1918.
Despite his failure in Verdun, he and the German staff need to be credited with have prevented an Ottoman genocide towards Christians and Jews in Palestine similiar to the Armenian suffering.
Wikipedia: 'His positive legacy is his conduct during the war in Palestine in 1917. As his biographer Afflerbach claims, &amp;quot;An inhuman excess against the Jews in Palestine was only prevented by Falkenhayn's conduct, which against the background of the German history of the 20th century has a special meaning, and one that distinguishes Falkenhayn.&amp;quot; (1994, 485)

      <description>Photograph taken by a pilot/observer of the German flying detachment 300 in 1917 or 1918.

The German-Ottoman airfield was located just South of the railway station. 
The aircrews were accomodated in the Kibbutz Degania, about half an hour away from the railway station. Despite the fact that houses were conviscated for German officers (ordinary German soldiers were using tents), both Jews and German military got well along with each other. The Germans provided the kibbutz with electricity and protected it against attacks of bedouins. The German Emperor's birthday and Tu biShvat, 27th and 28th of January 1918, were celebrated together in harmony...the Germans even dancing Horah.
Among the Jewish settlers were the parents of Moshe Dayan.

Kibbutz Degania was the first Jewish Colony in the history of Zionism, founded in 1909. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.degania.org.il/eng/general.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.degania.org.il/eng/general.htm&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>Samach was part of the Jezreel railway from Daraa in today Syria to Haifa (Israel).
The station and the line from Samach until Tul Karem was run until 1918 by the German Railway Detachment (Eisenbahn-Sonderkommando) 11.

This station saw in September 1918 heavy fighting between mostly German and Australian soldiers.

The train station Samach was defended by Captain (Hauptmann) Keyserlingk. According to one source, he had at his disposal a mixed troop of Germans (120) and Turkish (80) soldiers including 8 machine-guns. As the British reports state later a higher number of men captured, it is likely that he had received some reenforcements.
On September 25th 1918, at 4 am, the Australian Light Horse Brigade under Brigade-General Grant arrived for battle from Beisan. The predominant Australian/British troops won the battle after 1.5 hours. According to British reports, 98 Germans and Turkish were killed, 364 men were taken prisoners among which were 150 Germans. The British found in the village houses some 120 Turkish soldiers who had evaded the battle leading to the conclusion that most of the fighting was done by the small group of Germans. Especially the station was defended by the Germans with 'exceptional boldness and stubbornness' (H. S. Gullett's 'The Australian Imperial Force in Sinai and Palestine 1914-1918').

The Australians lost 15 men. The battle is considered as one of the most fierce and brutal in the Palestinian theater.
A diorama model of the battle used to be one of the main exhibition pieces of the Australian War Memorial in Canberra.

After the battle, the building had significant damages. To a certain extend it was repaired.

The Arab village of Tsemakh/Samach does not exist anymore. For details and its inhabitants check Wikipedia &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samakh,_Tiberias&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samakh,_Tiberias&lt;/a&gt;.

Since the line is not used anymore, the building decays. The station area is used today as storage-field and garbage dump.</description>

      <description>The former British Police Station still shows damage on its walls from the war in 1948.

In April-May 1948, the besieged Jews of the kibbutz Gesher (founded by German jews in 1939) in the British police station, together with soldiers of the Golani Brigade, succeeded in stopping the Arab attacks. Despite this success, the kibbutz was destroyed during combat.</description>

      <description>Beit Shean looks back on a history of 5.000 years of continuous occupation. It is believed that the first real town was founded around 3.000 BC. The site was used  by Egyptian Pharaos, Israelite tribes, Philistines, Greek, Romans, Byzantines and Arabs.The city was devastated by an earthquake in 749 AD. Crusaders errected a fortress around 1140 but were later ejected by the Arabs. Afterwards, the Ottomans ruled the area for almost 400 years.</description>

      <description>The station is not anymore operating.
After World War II, leaders of various Jewish underground organizations in Mandate Palestine founded The Jewish Resistance Movement. One of the resistance's first operations was the Night of the Trains (November 1, 1945), in which 153 points along various railways in the mandate were damaged. The main damage to the valley line was done at a railway switch near the Afula station.
In 1948 several bridges connecting Israel with Syria were blown up by Israeli soldiers. The railroad was thus rendered inoperable, and what remained of it was transferred to Israel Railways upon the company's founding. The company made minor repairs along the line, which allowed trains to travel between Haifa and Afula. Repairs to the aforementioned damage inflicted by the Jewish forces during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War were never conducted. Service on the new shortened line was terminated in 1949.</description>

      <description>Founded in 1911, it was the first modern Jewish settlement/colony in the Jezreel Valley. The village was established as the Co-operative in Merhavia, a co-operative farm, based on the ideas of Franz Oppenheimer (a German-Jewish sociologist and political economist). 

The founders had arrived in the area in 1910 and consisted of members of Kvutzat Kibush and workers of the Second Aliyah. It was supposed to operate as a co-operative farm with differential wages, and was founded with the assistance of Arthur Ruppin, Yehoshua Hankin, the Anglo-Palestine Bank and Eliyahu Blumenfeld.

Alexander Baerwald designed and built the first solid buildings and the road net with a central square in 1915.

In 1922 it was converted to a moshav ovdim after being joined by Polish immigrants and residents of Tel Aviv who wanted to work in agriculture. In 1929 a kibbutz, also by the name of Merhavia, was established next to the moshav.

Alexander Baerwald was a German Jewish architect best known for his work in Haifa, Israel.

Baerwald was born in Berlin, Germany on 3 March 1877. He studied at the Technische Hochschule Charlottenburg (1897-1901), interrupted by the summer semester 1898 at the Technische Hochschule of Munich. From 1903 to 1927 he was employed with the Prussian Construction and Financial Direction of Berlin, responsible for public constructions in Berlin. He advanced to become a Royal Ministerial Construction Councillor (German: Königlicher Ministerialbaurat). One of his tasks was the construction management for the new building of the Prussian Royal Library (German: Königliche Bibliothek), in Berlin between 1908 and 1913. The building known for its Neo Baroque architecture, following a design of the popular Wilhelmine architect Ernst Eberhard von Ihne, adapted by Baerwald, is now the House I of the State Library at Berlin of Prussian Cultural Heritage (German: Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin - Preußischer Kulturbesitz), in Unter den Linden street. After designing several other structures in the capital in the early 1910s, including his own villa in Berlin-Dahlem (1912), he moved to Ottoman Palestine temporarily around 1912 where he began work in Haifa.

Baerwald is best known for designing the Technion University campus in Haifa, Israel between 1912 and 1924, for which he had been employed by the Hilfsverein der deutschen Juden (Relief association of the German Jews). He also designed the neighbouring building of the Beit Sefer haReali (German: Realgymnasium), a school to prepare pupils for a study at the Technion. Today the old Technion building forms part of the Israel National Museum of Science, Technology, and Space. He became a Professor of Architecture at the Technion throughout much of his later life and he made a significant contribution to the Prussian academic discipline in the country.

In 1915 he built the moshav of Merchavya after his designs. In 1924 he designed the Anglo-Palestine Bank department in Haifa, now operating as Bank Le'umi Le-Israel. He also designed numerous other buildings in Palestine, and in 1925 Baerwald had settled there permanently. There he was acclaimed for introducing academic architecture to the country. By the late 1920s he had designed the Central Hospital, Afula in 1928, and the Phillips House, in Haifa (1929–30) shortly before his death on 27 October 1930 in Haifa.

      <description>The cemetary also houses tombs of nurses and priests who worked in the hospital after the war, to be seen in the foreground.

The remains of about 220 German soldiers of WW1 are buried here. The German losses in Palestine are estimated at about 800 men. 

Only a few died actually in Nazareth. However, for easier and cheaper coordination, all tombs which could be identified after WW1 were gathered here. Some tombs contain actually the bones while others serve as memorial as their tombs have not been found after the war such as those of the battle of Msallabe (Jordan valley, near Naaran). Some Germans are buried on the ground of Allied war cemeteries or in Jerusalem.

Nazareth houses the tombs of former German war cemeteries of Anabta, Beersheva, Bidia, Hanun et-Tireh, Jenin, Maan, Mafrak, Es-Salt, Samach and Tul Karem. 

Inaugurated in 1935, the area belonged earlier to the Austrian Hospice, managed by the Barmherzigen Brüder, and is now attached to the 'Italian hospital'.

During WW2, the Spanish consul de Ballobar and later Marrades looked after the German interests such as the cemetary while the Austrian monchs were detained. Only by 1952, the Hospice was returned to the monchs, later been give to their Italian monchs of the same order fate-bene-fratelli. They also cared for the cemetery with payment for the German Volksbund für Kriegsgräberfürsorge.
 
Germany and Israel started diplomatic contacts by 1965 which enabled German diplomats to visit the cemetary again. Since 1983, once a year there is an event on the ground invited by the German embassy in Tel Aviv which hosts next to Israeli also international guests in order to commemorate the fallen.

Since 2001, Dr. Schwake, a German doctor who is living in Israel for more than 30 years, is on behalf of the Kriegsgräberfürsorge responsible for the cemetery and he does a great job!

The cemetery is not mentioned in any German guide book.</description>

      <description>This tomb contains the remains of Ltn. Hans Przyszkowski, Flakzug (anti-air platoon) 177, and six of his men who died according to the inscription on 4th of May 1918. Despite being under heavy fire and air attacks, the platoon continued to fire against the assaulting Allied aeroplanes near at Tul Karem. They did so until a direct hit by a bomb. The entire group died and was buried at the German war cemetary in Tul Karem, later moved to Nazareth.
The handwritten document was written by the same Ltn. Przyszkowski acknowledging that Unteroffizier (Sergeant) Franz Lipkowski of Flakzug 177 had received the Gallipoli Star on 11th of May 1918 in Tul Karem, date of issue 6th of May 1918. Either the date of the inscription is wrong or the officer dated the document in advance as he would not have been able to write it on 6th of May when he already had died on 4th of May.</description>

      <description>The tombs contains a soldier of Hafir el Audja. Similar to Beer Sheva, nothing reminds of the fallen German soldiers of WW1 in the Sinai desert. Rather recently, a small memorial was errected for the 298 Ottoman soldiers who had died in and around Beersheva. In contrasts, there is a huge and well cared Allied war cemetery in Beersheva. Unfortunately, the German govt. seems not very much interested to do something about it. Probably, even they have forgotten about those men who died in Palestine. Even the cemetery in Nazareth suffers from low budget. Without the efforts and care of Dr. Schwake, the place would not be in such a good shape.</description>

      <description>When finished in 1935, all tombs who could been identified in other German war cemeteries such tombs from Jordan, except Syria, were centralised in Nazareth for a better coordination of the efforts. At that time, shortly after the world crisis and suffering under heavy war debts/payments, the German funds had been very limited to that a single place was easier to care and to finance than several cemeteries in the region.</description>

Telegraphen-Abteilung 'Kleinasien' (Army Group F, Imperial German-Ottoman Telegraphical Detachment 'Asia Minor') as motorcyclists. He had been serving already in Beersheva in 1916 (second advance against the Suez) and later in Gaza, he was awarded the Gallipoli star (Eiserner Halbmond) in Tell Sheria.
The German-Ottoman HQ was located in mid-1918 in Nazareth.</description>

      <description>The church was established at the site where, according to Roman Catholic tradition, the Annunciation took place. Greek Orthodox tradition holds that this event occurred while Mary was drawing water from a local spring in Nazareth, and the Greek Orthodox Church of the Annunciation was erected at that alternate site.

The current church is a two-story building constructed in 1969 over the site of an earlier Byzantine-era and then Crusader-era church. Inside, the lower level contains the Grotto of the Annunciation, believed by many Christians to be the remains of the original childhood home of Mary. Under Roman Catholic canon law, the church enjoys the status of a minor basilica. A historically significant site, considered sacred within some circles of Christianity, particularly Catholicism, the basilica attracts many Catholic, Anglican, and Eastern Orthodox Christian visitors every year.

      <description>According to Christian tradition, Mount Tabor is one of the possible sites of the Transfiguration of Christ, during which Jesus began to radiate light and was seen conversing with Moses and Elijah. The scene is in the Synoptic Gospels, as well as alluded to in 2Peter 1:16-18, but neither account identifies the &amp;quot;high mountain&amp;quot; of the scene by name. The earliest identification of the Mount of Transfiguration as Tabor is by Origen in the 3rd century. It is also mentioned by St. Cyril of Jerusalem and St. Jerome in the 4th century.[3] It is later mentioned in the 5th century Transitus Beatae Mariae Virginis. Mount Hermon is an alternative site according to tradition.

In 1101, when Crusaders controlled the area, the Benedictine monks rebuilt a ruined basilica and erected a fortified abbey.[4]

Currently, on the mountaintop there are two Christian monasteries, divided into Eastern Orthodox (northeast) and Roman Catholic (southeast) areas.

According to descriptions of the pilgrims, during the 6th century there were three churches on the top of the mountain, and during the 8th century there were four churches and a monastery. During the Arab period, in 947, a battle occurred in mount Tabor between different streams on the control of the land of Israel on behalf of the Abbasid Caliphate.

During the period of the Crusades, the mountain changed hands many times between Muslims and Christians. In 1099 the crusaders fortified the area of the church and the monastery which was on the peak of the mountain, in order to protect the pilgrims from the Muslims attacks. In 1212 the mountain was occupied by the Ayyubid Sultan Al-Adil I which established on it a larger fortress but in 1229 it was occupied again by the Christians. In 1263 the Mamluk ruler Baibars occupied the fortress and ruined the buildings on the mountain.

Between 1919 until 1924 an impressive Roman Catholic church of the Franciscan order named &amp;quot;Church of the Transfiguration&amp;quot; was built on the peak of Mount Tabor. The architect who designed the church, as well as other churches in Israel, was Antonio Barluzzi. The church was built upon the ruins of a Byzantine church from the fifth or sixth century and a Crusader church from the 12th century, which was built in honor of Tancred, Prince of Galilee. The friars of the church live next to the church in a monastery established in 1873.</description>

Franciscan Wedding Church, in front the Greek-Orthodox church.
John 2:1-11 reports that while Jesus was attending a wedding in Cana with his disciples the hosts ran out of wine. Jesus' mother (unnamed in John's Gospel) told Jesus, &amp;quot;They have no more wine,&amp;quot; and Jesus replied, &amp;quot;Dear woman, why do you involve me? My time has not yet come.&amp;quot; Jesus' mother then said to the servants, &amp;quot;Do whatever he tells you&amp;quot; (John 2:3-5). Jesus ordered the servants to fill the empty containers with water and to draw out some and take it to the chief waiter. After tasting the water that had become wine, and not knowing what Jesus had done, he remarked to the bridegroom that he had departed from the custom of serving the best wine first by serving it last (John 2:6-10). John concludes his account by saying: &amp;quot;This was the first miracle of Jesus and it was performed to reveal his glory, and his disciples put their faith in him (John 2:11)&amp;quot;.

      <description>German colony Bethlehem, German-Palestine Architecture.

In 1906 Templers from the German Colony in Haifa established a colony in the Galilee.

After 1939, all Germans in Palestine turned into Enemy aliens. Some of the settlers with patriotic feelings went to Germany to join the war. Several were organised in Palestine in Nazi-organisations such as Hitler Youth, but many others were not. The British authorities decided to intern most of the enemy aliens. For this purpose four settlements Sarona, Bethlehem, Waldheim and Wilhelma were converted into internment camps. In summer 1941, 665 German internees, almost all young families with children, were released to Australia, where they could settle again. Many of the remaining Germans were either too old or too sick, to leave for Australia, while a second group did not want to go there. In December 1941 and in the course of 1942 another 400 German internees, mostly wives and children of men, who had followed the calls for recruitment and had left for Germany, were released to Germany on the purpose of Family reunification. By that time, almost all Nazi supporters or partriots among the settlers had left Palestine.

In 1945 the Italian and Hungarian internees were released from Bethlehem and the other camps. But the Britons refused to repatriate the remaining German internees to the British zone in Germany, because the British zone was flooded with millions of war refugees. Also most of the internees did not want to go to Germany, they had their home in Palestine. In 1947 the British authorities and Australia agreed to allow the remaining German internees to emigrate to the fifth continent. The end of the Mandate forced to hurry the resettlement, thus all the internees were first transferred to Cyprus, to a camp of simple tents near Famagusta. The internees of Bethlehem could leave the place safely. 

On April 17, 1948 armed Jewish Palestinians conquered the neighboured internment camp of Waldheim, killing two colonists and severely wounding a woman. (Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonei_Abba)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonei_Abba)&lt;/a&gt;.

By May 14, 1948, when Israel became independent, only about 50 Gentile Germans, mostly elderly and sick persons, were living in the new state. They voluntarily left the country or were successively expelled by the government.</description>

The settlement was inaugurated on the occasion of Harvest Festival (German: Erntedankfest) on October 6, 1907. Then, the new Waldheimers still lived in the simple clay huts bought from the previous owners. The Haifa engineer Ernst August Voigt presented the plan of the streets and the 16 sites around a central site, reserved for a church. In 1909 the Jerusalemsverein (English: Association of Jerusalem), a Berlin-based organisation supportive of Protestant activities in the Holy Land, contributed money for the development of a water supply. By 1914, the Waldheimers planted vineyards of 5,000 square meters and more than 500 olive trees.[5] In December 1913, the farmers of Waldheim and Bethlehem keeping dairy cattle founded a common dairy cooperative to pasteurise milk and deliver it to Haifa.

For this purpose four settlements Sarona, Bethlehem, Waldheim and Wilhelma were converted into internment camps. In summer 1941, 665 German internees, almost all young families with children, were released to Australia, where they could settle again. Many of the remaining Germans were either too old or too sick, to leave for Australia, while a second group did not want to go there. In December 1941 and in the course of 1942 another 400 German internees, mostly wives and children of men, who had followed the calls for recruitment and had left for Germany, were released to Germany on the purpose of Family reunification. By that time, almost all Nazi supporters or partriots among the settlers had left Palestine.

In 1945 the Italian and Hungarian internees were released from Bethlehem and the other camps. But the Britons refused to repatriate the remaining German internees to the British zone in Germany, because the British zone was flooded with millions of war refugees. Also most of the internees did not want to go to Germany, they had their home in Palestine. In 1947 the British authorities and Australia agreed to allow the remaining German internees to emigrate to the fifth continent. The end of the Mandate forced to hurry the resettlement, thus all the internees were first transferred to Cyprus, to a camp of simple tents near Famagusta. The internees of Bethlehem could leave the place safely. 

On 17 April 1948, armed entities of the Haganah entered Waldheim, with the few British soldiers under camp commander Alan Tilbury unable to impede them, killing two colonists and severely wounding a woman.

By May 14, 1948, when Israel became independent, only about 50 Gentile Germans, mostly elderly and sick persons, were living in the new state. They voluntarily left the country or were successively expelled by the government.</description>

The settlement was inaugurated on the occasion of Harvest Festival (German: Erntedankfest) on October 6, 1907. Then, the new Waldheimers still lived in the simple clay huts bought from the previous owners. The Haifa engineer Ernst August Voigt presented the plan of the streets and the 16 sites around a central site, reserved for a church. In 1909 the Jerusalemsverein (English: Association of Jerusalem), a Berlin-based organisation supportive of Protestant activities in the Holy Land, contributed money for the development of a water supply. By 1914, the Waldheimers planted vineyards of 5,000 square meters and more than 500 olive trees.[5] In December 1913, the farmers of Waldheim and Bethlehem keeping dairy cattle founded a common dairy cooperative to pasteurise milk and deliver it to Haifa.

      <description>The station is one of the old Ottoman stations along the Haifa railway/Jezreel Valley railway which run from Daraa (also called Dera or Derat in Southern Syria) to Haifa in order to connect Palestine with the Hejaz railway system. 

The beginning of the end of the Jezreel Valley railway is considered March 2, 1948. On this date at night, Haganah forces carried out bombing raids on railways in Mandate Palestine and harmed them significantly. The aim of the operation was to disable the maintenance ability of the lines, in order to prevent the quick transport of supplies and personnel by the Arab armies about to invade the Yishuv. The most severe raid was carried out on a bridge near Geva, on the 44th km of the line, which effectively disabled its entire operation.

The next major hit came on the eve of the Israeli declaration of independence, May 14, 1948, when Jewish forces destroyed yet another bridge, this time on the Jordan River, next to Gesher. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jezreel_Valley_railway&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jezreel_Valley_railway&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>The Templers, a religious Protestant sect formed in southern Germany (Württemberg near Stuttgart) in the 19th century, settled in near Haifa in 1869. At that time, Haifa was nothing more than a small village. In 1875, the German community consisted of 300 people. Here and in other colonies (at that time another word for settlements) in Palestine, they contributed a lot to the development of Ottoman Palestine such as infrastructure (road construction, carriage service and the harbour of Haifa). The last Templers (based on the idea of an temple for God) had to leave Israel in 1950.

The German settlements came as something of a surprise to the advancing allies during WWI [from &amp;quot;With our Army in Palestine&amp;quot; by Anthony Bluett, Late of 'A' Battery, HAC &amp;amp; Egyptian Camel Transport Corps]

'I wonder how many people are aware of the extent to which the Germans carried their policy of &amp;quot;peaceful penetration&amp;quot; in Palestine and Syria? Whenever in our wanderings we came across a neat, modern town or village, be sure that the inhabitants were mainly German.....The language of all was German, and their extraordinary thoroughness in devising means to overcome the climatic and other difficulties of the country was also German, with the result that they waxed fat and prosperous, while the people indigenous to the soil scraped a precarious living by tending the flocks and tilling the land of the interlopers.'

Approx. taken around 1916 by a German soldier.

The big watermarks had to be placed after massive illegal downloads. One of the thieves, Ege Çinar Arcan of Turkey, even published a book with historical photographs which he had illegally downloaded from my photostream.</description>

      <description>Unfortunately, that night we had a fire alarm...running out the building was very disciplined and firefighters had arrived very fast. Fortunately, it turned out to be a false alarm...the manager of the accomodation was deeply frustrated and embarrased. It was my first real fire alarm I had to experience and I am happy it was in this place as everything was well organised. In general, the accomodation is superb and the false alarm just gave a reason to smile and to have a after-sun downer ;-)</description>

      <description>From Queenstown I drove to Te Anau. Arriving there, it was all covered in clouds and rain...no view further than 40 meters..typical Milford weather. When I left the next morning, I wasn`t even able to see the lakes despite living almost next to it. Driving towards Milford was slow due to limited view...I wondered if I would see the rocks of Milford at all....</description>

      <description>Despite I had asked to get merely the hair wet, I got up to the hips into the water. Obviously, these guys of the staff did not really care much about it. Thanks God it wasn't a concrete ground but just water. Whatever, I made it.

      <description>During another 15 or 20 minutes in the second snow storm, the view was again only some 10 meters. Fortunately, the trail is well signed so it was easy to continue. The only regret is, you cannot see the hostile beauty around you. Then again, I was lucky. The snow ended and the clouds broke up revealing once more this unique landscape including the big Blue Lake.</description>

      <description>Just after the picture, a heavy snowstorm started out of the &amp;quot;nothing&amp;quot;. The wind was strong, making it feel even more cold...the snow was passing me on a horizontal line :-)
It lastet about 20 or 30 minutes. During that time, the view was about 10 meters only...all people kept walking and despite most were freezing, and some even with snikers, noone was complaining...quite unusual :-)</description>

      <description>This peace out of my collection was awarded to a German crewmember of SMS Wolf.

SMS Wolf was a merchant raider,a pirate ship, operating successfully in the Far East, New Zealand and Australia under the command of captain Nerger. Wolf left Germany in Nov. 1916 and returned in Feb. 1918. During that time, the crew relied upon itself and its captures. Nerger was rewarded the Pour le Mérit, the highest German order.

      <description>Postcard out of my collection signed by Luckner himself after the war.

During WW I, Luckner and the SMS Seeadler, the Emperor's Pirates, left Germany in Dec. 1916. The Seeadler raided merchant ships in Africa and the Americas. They got famous for raiding without casualties. A tsunami destroyed SMS Seeadler near Tahiti. Trying to move further, we and parts of his crew were eventually captured on Fiji. They were detained in Motuihe Island, off Auckland, New Zealand. Luckner was repatriated to Germany in 1919. By then, he was a war-hero nicknamed the &amp;quot;Sea-Devil&amp;quot;.

      <description>From the camping site we had to leave very early long before sunrise. Of course, it did not work out as smooth as we had planned. We were in a rush to be at the dune in time. On the way, an antilope crossed our way (running into our path....are there suicide antilopes?) and we nearly hit the poor thing. Well, as can be seen, we made it and nobody was hurt :-)</description>

We met along Annapurna Curcuit and went walking for a week which was great fun with him. Unfortunately, he died in September 2008...just unbelievable..

British climber freezes to death in snowstorm on Mont Blanc
By Gavin Madeley 
on 17th September 2008

A British climber froze to death near the summit of Europe's highest mountain after becoming trapped for two nights in a snow hole.

Simon Triger, a researcher at Glasgow University, and climbing partner Iain Mount were 13,000ft up Mont Blanc when they were forced to take shelter from driving snowstorms.

After two nights in extreme weather and freezing temperatures, Dr Triger, 31, an experienced hill runner and Alpinist, succumbed to the effects of the cold.

Incredibly, Mr Mount was saved after he left the snow hole to try to find emergency supplies that had been dropped by a helicopter.

When poor visibility left him unable to retrace his steps to their shelter, he decided to head down the mountain and was eventually picked up by the rescue helicopter, cold but otherwise unhurt.

Last night, 30-year-old Mr Mount's stepfather, Glenn Ralston, spoke about the ordeal, saying it was &amp;quot;sheer luck&amp;quot; that helped him survive.

He said both men were experienced climbers and had already climbed the Eiger and the Matterhorn together and, before the tragic accident, Dr Triger - known affectionately as 'Trigger - was planning to climb the Himalayas.

Mr Ralston said: &amp;quot;They were always very sensible and checked the weather forecast that said it was at least three or four days before the bad weather would hit. The emergency services told us they did everything right - it was just one of those things.&amp;quot;

The pair set off from the Gonella refuge on the Italian side of Mont Blanc last week and made it to the top last Tuesday. 

&amp;quot;As they were coming down, the weather just closed in,&amp;quot; said Mr Ralston. 

&amp;quot;They got to the nearest safety hut, a bit like a Scottish 'bothy', to work out their next move.

&amp;quot;They decided the best thing to do was to dig a snow hole and get in it for the night. The next morning the weather wasn't any better so they texted mountain rescue to give their position and to say they were okay.&amp;quot;

By then, the weather and visibility were so poor that rescue efforts had to be abandoned.

On Wednesday, Sheffield-born Mr Triger's condition started deteriorating rapidly; his speech was garbled and he was hallucinating.

Mr Mount, originally from Wakefield, West Yorkshire, contacted mountain rescuers again, who agreed to drop emergency supplies.

Mr Ralston said: &amp;quot;They dropped blankets, food and a Primus stove. Iain heard the drop, but couldn't see it through the fog.

&amp;quot;After searching, he found the food and the stove but not the blankets, and then he realised he couldn't find his way back to the snow hole and Simon.

&amp;quot;He had to shelter in a crevice overnight, he couldn't open the food because of frostbite and he couldn't get the stove to work.&amp;quot;

As the weather cleared last Thursday morning, the helicopter crew spotted Iain near the Dome du Gouter - at 13,000ft the third highest peak in the Mont Blanc group - and winched him to safety.

However, when he begged them to find his friend, the rescue team told him it would prove impossible to find the snow hole. They planted flags in the snow to give them a rough idea of where to begin searching for the stricken climber, when the storms cleared.

Around five hours later they found Mr Triger still in the snow hole but no longer alive.

&amp;quot;They took Iain down the mountain and he was questioned by police who were brilliant with him,&amp;quot; said Mr Ralston.

&amp;quot;They placed him with a French family until he got his strength back and then he drove himself home from Chamonix back to Nottingham on Sunday.

&amp;quot;He lost three quarters of a stone and has frostbite in his hands but we aren't sure how serious yet. We are going to see him tomorrow. His mother, Angela, hasn't seen him since it happened and she just wants to hold her baby.

&amp;quot;Iain is very upset about what happened, but has already said he wants to carry on climbing in Simon's memory. That is a common sentiment among the climbing fraternity, I gather.&amp;quot;

Yesterday, tributes poured in for Dr Triger, a keen mountaineer, hill runner and canoeist who had worked for the past two years at Glasgow University's microsystems technology group.

More than 20 messages were posted on the website of Glasgow-based Westerlands Cross Country Club, where he was a member.

A statement on the site read: &amp;quot;Despite being a highly experienced climber, Simon was unexpectedly caught out and trapped by a severe storm, and was unable to be rescued.

&amp;quot;Simon was a rare and unique character. He never had a bad word to say against anyone, and seemed on a mission to spread positive energy into the world, and get the most possible out of his life, packed to the brim with non-stop outdoor adventures and experiences.

&amp;quot;It is hard to imagine not seeing Simon again. His good humour and laughter always brightened up every club run, even in the depths of winter. Simon will be deeply missed by all who knew him.&amp;quot;

Prof David Cumming, of Glasgow University's department of electronics and electrical engineering, said: &amp;quot;Simon was a great contributor. He was a lively character, very bright and very capable who will be deeply missed.&amp;quot;</description>

      <description>During the snow storm, I had passed thru the central crater without seeing much. Standing here, looking back, it was again amazing to look at God's creation.</description>

      <description>During another 15 or 20 minutes in the second snow storm, the view was again only some 10 meters. Fortunately, the trail is well signed so it was easy to continue. The only regret is, you cannot see the hostile beauty around you. Then again, I was lucky. The snow ended and the clouds broke up revealing once more this unique landscape including the big Blue Lake.</description>

      <description>Just after the picture, a heavy snowstorm started out of the &amp;quot;nothing&amp;quot;. The wind was strong, making it feel even more cold...the snow was passing me on a horizontal line :-)
It lastet about 20 or 30 minutes. During that time, the view was about 10 meters only...all people kept walking and despite most were freezing, and some even with snikers, noone was complaining...quite unusual :-)</description>

      <description>This peace out of my collection was awarded to a German crewmember of SMS Wolf.

SMS Wolf was a merchant raider,a pirate ship, operating successfully in the Far East, New Zealand and Australia under the command of captain Nerger. Wolf left Germany in Nov. 1916 and returned in Feb. 1918. During that time, the crew relied upon itself and its captures. Nerger was rewarded the Pour le Mérit, the highest German order.

      <description>Welcome of captain Nerger and crew in Berlin after their adventures.

SMS Wolf was a merchant raider,a pirate ship, operating successfully in the Far East, New Zealand and Australia under the command of captain Nerger. Wolf left Germany in Nov. 1916 and returned in Feb. 1918. During that time, the crew relied upon itself and its captures. Nerger was rewarded the Pour le Mérit, the highest German order.

      <description>Postcard out of my collection signed by Luckner himself after the war.

During WW I, Luckner and the SMS Seeadler, the Emperor's Pirates, left Germany in Dec. 1916. The Seeadler raided merchant ships in Africa and the Americas. They got famous for raiding without casualties. A tsunami destroyed SMS Seeadler near Tahiti. Trying to move further, we and parts of his crew were eventually captured on Fiji. They were detained in Motuihe Island, off Auckland, New Zealand. Luckner was repatriated to Germany in 1919. By then, he was a war-hero nicknamed the &amp;quot;Sea-Devil&amp;quot;.

      <description>From the camping site we had to leave very early long before sunrise. Of course, it did not work out as smooth as we had planned. We were in a rush to be at the dune in time. On the way, an antilope crossed our way (running into our path....are there suicide antilopes?) and we nearly hit the poor thing. Well, as can be seen, we made it and nobody was hurt :-)</description>

We met along Annapurna Curcuit and went walking for a week which was great fun with him. Unfortunately, he died in September 2008...just unbelievable..

British climber freezes to death in snowstorm on Mont Blanc
By Gavin Madeley 
on 17th September 2008

A British climber froze to death near the summit of Europe's highest mountain after becoming trapped for two nights in a snow hole.

Simon Triger, a researcher at Glasgow University, and climbing partner Iain Mount were 13,000ft up Mont Blanc when they were forced to take shelter from driving snowstorms.

After two nights in extreme weather and freezing temperatures, Dr Triger, 31, an experienced hill runner and Alpinist, succumbed to the effects of the cold.

Incredibly, Mr Mount was saved after he left the snow hole to try to find emergency supplies that had been dropped by a helicopter.

When poor visibility left him unable to retrace his steps to their shelter, he decided to head down the mountain and was eventually picked up by the rescue helicopter, cold but otherwise unhurt.

Last night, 30-year-old Mr Mount's stepfather, Glenn Ralston, spoke about the ordeal, saying it was &amp;quot;sheer luck&amp;quot; that helped him survive.

He said both men were experienced climbers and had already climbed the Eiger and the Matterhorn together and, before the tragic accident, Dr Triger - known affectionately as 'Trigger - was planning to climb the Himalayas.

Mr Ralston said: &amp;quot;They were always very sensible and checked the weather forecast that said it was at least three or four days before the bad weather would hit. The emergency services told us they did everything right - it was just one of those things.&amp;quot;

The pair set off from the Gonella refuge on the Italian side of Mont Blanc last week and made it to the top last Tuesday. 

&amp;quot;As they were coming down, the weather just closed in,&amp;quot; said Mr Ralston. 

&amp;quot;They got to the nearest safety hut, a bit like a Scottish 'bothy', to work out their next move.

&amp;quot;They decided the best thing to do was to dig a snow hole and get in it for the night. The next morning the weather wasn't any better so they texted mountain rescue to give their position and to say they were okay.&amp;quot;

By then, the weather and visibility were so poor that rescue efforts had to be abandoned.

On Wednesday, Sheffield-born Mr Triger's condition started deteriorating rapidly; his speech was garbled and he was hallucinating.

Mr Mount, originally from Wakefield, West Yorkshire, contacted mountain rescuers again, who agreed to drop emergency supplies.

Mr Ralston said: &amp;quot;They dropped blankets, food and a Primus stove. Iain heard the drop, but couldn't see it through the fog.

&amp;quot;After searching, he found the food and the stove but not the blankets, and then he realised he couldn't find his way back to the snow hole and Simon.

&amp;quot;He had to shelter in a crevice overnight, he couldn't open the food because of frostbite and he couldn't get the stove to work.&amp;quot;

As the weather cleared last Thursday morning, the helicopter crew spotted Iain near the Dome du Gouter - at 13,000ft the third highest peak in the Mont Blanc group - and winched him to safety.

However, when he begged them to find his friend, the rescue team told him it would prove impossible to find the snow hole. They planted flags in the snow to give them a rough idea of where to begin searching for the stricken climber, when the storms cleared.

Around five hours later they found Mr Triger still in the snow hole but no longer alive.

&amp;quot;They took Iain down the mountain and he was questioned by police who were brilliant with him,&amp;quot; said Mr Ralston.

&amp;quot;They placed him with a French family until he got his strength back and then he drove himself home from Chamonix back to Nottingham on Sunday.

&amp;quot;He lost three quarters of a stone and has frostbite in his hands but we aren't sure how serious yet. We are going to see him tomorrow. His mother, Angela, hasn't seen him since it happened and she just wants to hold her baby.

&amp;quot;Iain is very upset about what happened, but has already said he wants to carry on climbing in Simon's memory. That is a common sentiment among the climbing fraternity, I gather.&amp;quot;

Yesterday, tributes poured in for Dr Triger, a keen mountaineer, hill runner and canoeist who had worked for the past two years at Glasgow University's microsystems technology group.

More than 20 messages were posted on the website of Glasgow-based Westerlands Cross Country Club, where he was a member.

A statement on the site read: &amp;quot;Despite being a highly experienced climber, Simon was unexpectedly caught out and trapped by a severe storm, and was unable to be rescued.

&amp;quot;Simon was a rare and unique character. He never had a bad word to say against anyone, and seemed on a mission to spread positive energy into the world, and get the most possible out of his life, packed to the brim with non-stop outdoor adventures and experiences.

&amp;quot;It is hard to imagine not seeing Simon again. His good humour and laughter always brightened up every club run, even in the depths of winter. Simon will be deeply missed by all who knew him.&amp;quot;

Prof David Cumming, of Glasgow University's department of electronics and electrical engineering, said: &amp;quot;Simon was a great contributor. He was a lively character, very bright and very capable who will be deeply missed.&amp;quot;</description>

      <description>From left: the admin nun, myself, Ram and Simon. I had met Simon as we stayed in the same guesthouse in Gasa on the way to Jomsom. From there we travelled together the Trek. A real pleasure to have met him and a great travel companion!!! Take care Si!

Update: On 18th of Feb. 2010, after my email was returned by the system, I had googled Simon and had to learn about his death at the age of only 31. I couldn't believe what I saw...
 
Although this tragedy occured already in September 2008, I feel shocked. 
After having met in Nepal on the Muktinath-Trek and shared a great time, we had kept contact even after by Email. In mid 2008 the contact got lost and I had thought he had new, more important priorities (such as raising a family)....
 
Now, it turns out very different. As a passionated sportsman and mountaineer, he had died at Mont Blanc. What a waste of a wonderful humorous and gifted young man! I consider him a real &amp;quot;high potential&amp;quot;, not as those business snobs. I got to know him as really tough guy with an immense amount of discipline and strength. Actually, in Nepal walking with him, I got to know the difference of a hiker and a mountaineer (about the spot where we hikers notice our limits, the mountaineers start their tours). For Si, the trek was merely a warm-up, about two weeks later he was to meet his good friends to climb Ama Dablam. Next to his strength and determination, he was most of all a very friendly, kind, sincere, open-minded and humble person with a big heart and a very good sense of British humor. The perfect travel-companion. His friend Chris Upson expressed it perfectly &amp;quot;Simon was a rare and unique character. He never had a bad word to say against anyone, and seemed on a mission to spread positive energy into the world, and get the most possible out of his life, packed to the brim with non-stop outdoor adventures and experiences.&amp;quot; 
 
I had first met him briefly in Tatopani along the Annapurna Curcuit. A bit further towards Jomson, we stayed in the same guest house in Ghasa, ..and while making fun of a Bollywood b-movie we had a good laugh and started talking about life and everything else, laughing a lot including about ourselves. This kept on while we marched together via Kagbeni to Muktinath. Too bad I did not take a photograph when he was playing with locals kids in Kagbeni, a authentic and almost medieval village. The area is quite stunning but with his presence and good humor, his contagious smile, it was a great trip and a very good time. Back in Kathmandu, we had met again to have some beers and shared a good laugh. Even after returning to our countries, we stayed in touch for years and updated each other on our lives once in a while, shared thoughts and ideas, and it was always fun with him. It was quite impressive to learn from him about his career in Glasgow and his passion for extreme sports. I was quite amazed to hear him talking about all his activities...he seemed never to rest, so busy. The Sheffield Telegraph brought it to the point: &amp;quot;a short life lived to the full&amp;quot;. Whenever an Email of Si was in my inbox, it was the signal of something funny and witty was ahead...
Therefore, even though I was not among his inner circle of friends, I am greatful that I was lucky enough to have met him. I considered him a friend and he had left a great, positive impression.
I like the idea that where he is now, he has the chance to explore fantastic unknown mountains together with some of the finest mountaineers such as ....Sir Edmund Hillary or Jean-Christophe Lafaille or others...to live his passion and be happy.</description>

Eric Goossens of The Gallipoli Houses, was so kind to organise a translation of the inscription: 
&amp;quot;Ingiliz ve Fransizlarin Seddülbahir'den firarlari 27 Kanunuevvel 1331” which means in English: ”The escapes (runaways) of the English (British) and French on 9th January 1916”.
According to Eric, several of these were erected and several have been destroyed (!!) by the (British-French) occupations forces in 1919.
Eric runs a beautiful hotel and has a great page providing plenty of information: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gallipoli.com.tr/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;www.gallipoli.com.tr/&lt;/a&gt;</description>

It is one of the few photographs where German and Turkish sailors were posing together. Unfortunately, it was more commmon that each nation took their own photographs, such as in case of „Muavenet-i Milliye“ (it sunk HMS Goliath) where on most photographs you can see either Germans or Turks. There was also a mixed photograph but it is rare.</description>

      <description>Mount Nebo is where the Hebrew prophet Moses was given a view of the promised land that God was giving to the Jews. &amp;quot;And Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, the top of Pisgah, which is opposite Jericho.&amp;quot; (Deuteronomy 34:1).

According to Jewish and Christian tradition, Moses was buried on this mountain by God Himself, and his final resting place is unknown.</description>
